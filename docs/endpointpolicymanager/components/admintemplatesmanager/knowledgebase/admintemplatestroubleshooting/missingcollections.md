If your Admin Station is Windows 7, ensure you have .Net Framework 3.5 specifically installed on
your management station. Later versions of .Net Framework are not compatible with Netwrix Endpoint
Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) on Windows 7.

If your Admin Station is Windows 8 and later, ensure you have .Net Framework 4.0 or higher
specifically installed on your management station.
