# How do I use passwords with Group Policy Preferences items within Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud?

Neither the Microsoft MMC nor Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud enables you
to enter in passwords. This is because when the GPOs are housed in the domain, it can be used by
attackers to reverse engineer passwords stored in the GPOs.

In Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud this is less of a concern, because those fields are not readable by
everyone, only admins who log on to the console. That being said, this procedure is not guaranteed
to be safe, because the final cPassword values are transmitted to the endpoint and could be reverse
engineered there. So you will have to use your judgment to see if this procedure is worth it for
you.

**Step 1 –** If you want to use a Group Policy Preferences item along with a password field, start
by populating your Preferences item (on-prem recommended) with as much data as you can, noting that
the Connect as (or other fields) are not changeable in the MMC editor. Below are two examples.

**Step 2 –** Once you have the item, drag it to the desktop and open it for editing.  The goal is to
enter the missing details by hand, typically the cPassword field.

**Step 3 –** To do get a cPassword, you need to provide an encrypted value in quotes.

**Step 4 –** Utilize this code and replace the data string with your intended password.

```
require 'rubygems'
require 'openssl'
require 'base64'
data = " abc123"
def encrypt(data)
  key = "\x4e\x99\x06\xe8\xfc\xb6\x6c\xc9\xfa\xf4\x93\x10\x62\x0f\xfe\xe8\xf4\x96\xe8\x06\xcc\x05\x79\x90\x20\x9b\x09\xa4\x33\xb6\x6c\x1b"
  cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new("AES-256-CBC")
  cipher.encrypt
  cipher.key = key
  repacked = data.unpack('C*').pack('v*')
  encrypted_data = cipher.update(repacked) + cipher.final
  encrypted_data = Base64.encode64(encrypted_data)
  encrypted_data = encrypted_data[0, encrypted_data.index('=')]
end
encrypted_data = encrypt(data)
puts encrypted_data
```

You can test ithere:
[https://onecompiler.com/ruby/3y33cr579](https://onecompiler.com/ruby/3y33cr579)

Examples:

- Encrypting `Local*P4ssword!` provides `j1Uyj3Vx8TY9LtLZil2uAuZkFQA/4latT76ZwgdHdhw`
- Encrypting `abc123` gives `Uz2Lr4XKoAyUj1HhrWbTLA`

**Step 5 –** Once you have the well-formed XML you should be able to drag it back into the MMC
editor and test it (if you want).

Or you can upload the XML to Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

All well-formed XML will be accepted and should process on the endpoint.

:::note
Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences will need to be licensed for Endpoint Policy Manager
Cloud. In domain-joined scenarios that component is automatically disabled until expressly enabled.
