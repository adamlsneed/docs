**Step 4 –** Under the General tab set the **Startup:** to **Automatic**, then click the ellipsis
under Service Name: and select the service you would like to enable.

In this example, I selected the RPC service.

**Step 7 –** Now apply the GPO to the Computer OU where the computers live and where you want this
setting, and the next time `GPUPDATE` runs the service will be enabled.
