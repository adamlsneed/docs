# Adding a Collection

A Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Templates Manager collection enables you to assemble multiple
policies (or other collections) within it. By creating a collection, you are able to use Item-Level
Targeting to ensure that the collection's directives only apply to users or machines when certain
conditions are true.

To create a collection, follow these steps:

**Step 1 –** Go to the Endpoint Policy Manager **Admin Templates Manager** node and select **Add** >
**New Collection**.

**Step 2 –** Within Endpoint Policy Manager **Admin Templates Manager** editor, add a new
collection.

Once this is done, you are prompted to name the collection.

**Step 3 –** Keep the default name, or change it as needed. For instance, you may want to create a
collection of Control Panel settings that only affect your East Sales Users.

**Step 4 –** To create a user defined name for a collection, double-click the collection field, and
then add specific policies that you would like to apply only to your East Sales Users.

There are settings in the collection that affect only the specified users.

Next, we'll ensure that only the East Sales Users get these policy settings while using Item-Level
Targeting. See the
[Using Item-Level Targeting with Collections and Policies](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/admintemplatesmanager/manual/itemleveltargeting.md) topic for
additional information on the next steps.
