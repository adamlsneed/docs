# Understanding Priority

Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Templates Manager enables you to put policy directives inside a single
GPO and within a single collection. This is most useful when used in conjunction with Item-Level
Targeting, as described in the previous section.

Here you can see the same policy, **Screen saver timeout**, used three times within the same GPO.
However, each policy directive has **Item-Level Targeting** turned on and specific conditions
associated with it.

We recommend using Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Templates Manager in the following ways:

- Create multiple policy directives in a collection within a GPO
- Use Item-Level Targeting to set the conditions
- Set a description about that particular AppSet item (see the next section)

Occasionally there can be multiple AppSets that have overlapping settings. In that case, ensure that
the delivery of those settings occur in a particular order. As we see above, Endpoint Policy Manager
Admin Templates Manager enables you to specify the order policy settings are delivered in.

Policy settings within a GPO are processed in order from lowest to highest.

:::note
This is the same way Group Policy Preferences performs ordering as well.

To change the priority of a particular AppSet, click on it and select ether **Raise Priority**,
**Lower Priority**, **Maximum Priority**, or **Minimum Priority**.
