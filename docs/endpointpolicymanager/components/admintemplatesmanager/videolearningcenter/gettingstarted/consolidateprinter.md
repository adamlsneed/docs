# Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences: Printers (Consolidate GPOs and also deploy them via PP Cloud and your MDM service)

Customers want a quick way to consolidate GPOs to combat GPO sprawl. With Netwrix Endpoint Policy
Manager (formerly PolicyPak) you can literally reduce the amount of GPOs you have by consolidating
them into fewer or even ONE GPO. In this demonstration, you'll see how to consolidate PRINTER
PREFERENCES items for FEWER GPOs, plus convert them into an MSI for later deployment for use with an
MDM service like Intune. Magic provided ... only from Endpoint Policy Manager !
