# Central Storage for Endpoint Policy Manager Extension DLLs

As you've just learned in the previous section, there is no way to edit an existing GPO with
Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager directives or create new Endpoint Policy
Manager Application Settings Manager directives inside a new GPO if a Endpoint Policy Manager
extension DLL is not available on the local administrator's management station.

With that in mind, Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager can utilize a central
storage for Endpoint Policy Manager extension DLLs.

The Central Storage is a very simple idea: house the Endpoint Policy Manager extension DLLs within
the Active Directory's SYSVOL (which is replicated to all domain controllers). Then, whenever
they're needed, the Endpoint Policy Manager MMC will utilize the DLL contained within the Central
Storageâ€”automatically.

:::note
If you are familiar with Group Policy's ADMX Central Storage, this feature is identical
and accomplishes a similar task. For information on Microsoft's implementation of central storage,
please read
[Understanding and fixing Endpoint Policy Manager DLL Orphans](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/knowledgebase/applicationmanager/videolearningcenter/centralstoresharing/dllorphans.md).

Creating the Endpoint Policy Manager Central Storage is easy and only needs to be performed one
time. The actions that a domain administrator needs to perform are:

- On any domain controller (preferably the PDC emulator), use Explorer to locate the SYSVOL folder.
  On most domain controllers, the SYSVOL folder is located in `c:\windows\sysvol\sysvol`. (Note
  there are actually two directories named SYSVOL, one within the other, as seen in Figure 68).
- The name of your domain will be inside the SYSVOL folder. In this example, the domain name is
  corp.com. Inside the directory, there will be a folder named Policies, as seen in Figure 69.
- Inside the Policies folder, create a directory named PolicyPak, as also seen in Figure 69.
- Finally, copy (or move) your local Endpoint Policy Manager extension DLLs from your local
  administrator's machine's` c:\Program Files\PolicyPak\Extensions` to the newly created Endpoint
  Policy Manager folder at `c:\windows\SYSVOL\SYSVOL\policies\PolicyPak`. An example of this can be
  seen in Figure 70.

When you place all Endpoint Policy Manager extension DLLs in the Central Storage, the Endpoint
Policy Manager MMC console will automatically utilize it. That is, once the Endpoint Policy Manager
Central Storage is available, there is nothing else to configure.

Simply edit the existing GPO with Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager directives or
create a new GPO. You should immediately see your Endpoint Policy Manager extensions available in
the Endpoint Policy Manager | Applications flyout menu (as seen in Figure 71) and, when they're
utilized, you'll see the Extension Location change to Central Storage, as seen in Figure 72.

:::note
You may need to close the Group Policy Editor and then reopen it to see Endpoint Policy
Manager Application Settings Manager utilizing the Central Storage.

Note that only a domain administrator may place Endpoint Policy Manager extension DLLs into the
Central Storage. If an AppSet is later updated, only domain administrators will be able to perform
the update. For more information on updating AppSets, see the section "Version Control of Endpoint
Policy Manager Extension DLLs."

:::note
You're never "installing" these DLLs on the server. Nor are they copied inside each and
every GPO. They're simply placed, one time, into the Central Storage so that administrators can roam
from machine to machine and always have access to their Endpoint Policy Manager extension DLLs
whenever they run the GPMC. (You won't see the Endpoint Policy Manager node until the Endpoint
Policy Manager Admin Console.msi is installed alongside the GPMC.)
