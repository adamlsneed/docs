# Advanced AppSet Design and Manual Editing

In this section, we round up some tips and tricks for the advanced AppSet designer. The
Configuration Wizard is almost always the best way to configure each element in your AppSet.
However, there are occasions where some manual work and advanced techniques are necessary to finish
your AppSet and have it work the way you intend. You might also want to manually enter in data and
values. Let's explore all these areas.

## Basic Settings

By default, all elements show their basic view. You can see at a glance the most important items
that the Configuration Wizard has configured, as shown in Figure 142.

The Configuration Wizard should auto-fill in all basic properties for most items. However, one item
that might need attention is the label link. Remember, the label link is the item that describes
elements that have no text, like text boxes, spinboxes, dropdowns, sliders, and radio button groups.
To configure the label link for an item, click on "Label Link" in the properties of the item, select
the "â€¦" (not shown), and then select the text on the page that most closely represents what the text
box, spinbox, etc. is trying to configure. In Figure 143, the radio button group is being described
by the text "Associated image viewer."

## Advanced Settings

You can also click the "Advanced" button within Properties to see more detailed information about an
element, as shown in Figure 144.>

The Advanced menu contains sections labeled "Control data" and "Actions." The control data specifies
items like dimensions, the display name ("Text"), the default state, the revert state, whether or
not the item is disabled ("Enabled"), and whether or not the item's text will stretch within the
boundaries of the element's handles ("AutoSize"). The Actions area shows what occurs when the
checkbox is checked. In Figure 145, you can see the following:

- "First Action" performs a registry update.
- "`Reg. key`" is set to `WinZip\Policies`. This field is always relative to the data root, so the
  whole key is not usually shown. You will often see only `<project root>` there as well, signifying
  the value is directly within the project's data root.
- "`Reg. value`" is set to "passwordreqlower," the value in the registry.
- "Data type" is "String" (string registry type)
- "Sub type" (registry elements only) can be "Normal" or "Masked." "Normal" is the usual type, and
  "Masked" is automatically chosen when the value is detected as a binary value with a mask, which
  specifically flips specific binary bits on or off.
- The On value is 1. When the checkbox is checked, it sets the value to 1 inside "passwordreqlower."
- The Off value is 0. When the checkbox is un-checked (or the Group Policy falls out of scope) the
  value inside "passwordreqlower" is deleted.

It's possible to see (or set) second and third actions when an element changes. You can dictate
values within any of the supported datatypes, as shown in Figure 145.

You might want to do this if you had to configure both a registry item and also an INI file when a
checkbox is checked. This is a very rare occurrence, but it does happen.

After selecting the data type (Registry, INI, XML, etc.) you are then prompted for the section and
property (or registry key and registry value), which in Figure 146 are shown as "[MainFrame]" and
"AdvertiseIndex."

Once the value is manually selected, you are able to place the value automatically within the On or
Off values (or both or neither), as shown in Figure 147.

After placing the items, you can further specify the On and Off values within the action itself, as
shown in Figure 148. Checkboxes are only allowed three actions.
