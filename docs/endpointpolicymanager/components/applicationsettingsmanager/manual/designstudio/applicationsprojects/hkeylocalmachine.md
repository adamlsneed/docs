# Items That Use HKEY_Local_Machine

Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager has a facility to deploy registry keys to
`HKEY_Local_Machine`. This can come in handy if you are trying to manage an application that runs as
a service and has entries only in `HKEY_Local_Machine`. You set the project up as shown in Figure
213, then define the data root with a node within `HKEY_Local_Machine`.

Figure 213. Defining the data root as `HKEY_Local_Machine`.

However, when you do, you'll be prompted with a message suggesting that this might or might not work
as shown in Figure 214.

Figure 214. The warning when defining the data root as `HKEY_Local_Machine`.

If you are sure that the application's value is best suited for `HKEY_Local_Machine`, you can safely
ignore this warning.

:::note
You'll get the same message for applications that store most of their settings in
`HKEY_Current_User`, but have a handful of settings in `HKEY_Local_Machine`.

Acrobat Reader is an example in which most settings are in
`HKEY_Current_User\Software\Adobe\Acrobat Reader\10.0`, but the updater settings are stored within
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Adobe\Adobe ARM\1.0\ARM` in the iCheck setting.
