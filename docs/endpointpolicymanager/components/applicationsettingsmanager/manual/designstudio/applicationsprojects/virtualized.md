# Virtualized Applications

Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager supports five application virtualization
technologies: Microsoft App-V (from 4.2 up to 5.0), VMware ThinApp (4 and 5), Citrix XenApp
Streaming, `Spoon.Net` (or Novell ZENWorks Application Virtualization), and Symantec Workspace
Virtualization (SWV).

Creating application virtualization packages is beyond the scope of this document, but if you're
already using an application virtualization solution, then Endpoint Policy Manager Application
Settings Manager can manage those applications naturally using Group Policy.
