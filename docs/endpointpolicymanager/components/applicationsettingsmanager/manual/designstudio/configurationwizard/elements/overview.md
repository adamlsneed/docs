# Configuring Elements

Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio provides a wizard to configure the following element types:

- Checkboxes (which we performed an example of together in the Quickstart above)
- Radio buttons
- Sliders (horizontal and vertical)
- Spinboxes (up/down boxes)
- Text boxes
- Numeric boxes
- Combo boxes
- Folder browsers
- File browsers
- Font browsers

Most elements have the following constructs:

- Min
- Max
- Default state
- Revert state
- Step value (for sliders and spinboxes)
- Linked label (for items that cannot describe themselves)

We'll explore some of these element types in the following sections.
