# Text Boxes and Numeric Boxes

Text boxes and numeric boxes act very similarly. The goal is to make any change at all that can be
detected. You are then able to select the default and revert values and also the linked label. You
can choose the default of what was originally captured in the text box, or select the value you
changed to. See Figure 134 for an example of a numeric box.
