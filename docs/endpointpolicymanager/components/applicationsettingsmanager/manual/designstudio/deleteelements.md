# Deleting Stray Elements

You might want to use the Hierarchy tab to look within each tab for stray or odd elements. In Figure
158, you can see the Toolbar tab is being inspected. There is an unnamed element in the tab that
appears to be a graphic. However, that graphic isn't being used or even displayed. This could be
because extra elements were captured in the capturing process, a frame overlaps an element, or some
other undesired behavior is occurring. In this case, since the graphic isn't being used, it can be
deleted. You can right-click on the element in the hierarchy on the right or on the tab and then
delete it.
