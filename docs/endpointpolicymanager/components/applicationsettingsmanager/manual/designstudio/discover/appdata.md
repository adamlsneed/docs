# Configuration Data in %appdata%

If an application writes its configuration data to `c:\`, `c:\program files`, or

`c:\program files (x86)` then do the following:

**Step 1 –** Log in as a standard user.

**Step 2 –** Run the application.

**Step 3 –** Look for configuration data in the three likely locations:

1. `c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<app>`
2. `c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\<app>`
3. `c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\<app>`

**Step 4 –** Continue to run Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio as a standard user and perform all
your configurations.

**Step 5 –** When you run Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio as a standard user, you can select
the application's data file within `%appdata%`, even if you browse using the full path, starting
with `C:\`. Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio will automatically detect if you are within
`%appdata%` or `%localappdata%` and substitute the

`%appdata%` or `%localappdata%` variables for you as needed, as shown in Figure 99 and Figure 100.

:::note
You will not be able to compile your AppSet to a DLL as standard user unless you change
the location using Tools | Options. In the Compilation tab, select a writeable location for "Path
for compiled dlls." By default, Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio writes its compiled AppSets to
`c:\Program Files\PolicyPak` by design so non-administrators cannot utilize Endpoint Policy Manager
Application Settings Manager .dlls on machines.
:::


Therefore, capture all the data from your application first as a standard user, then test your
compiling as a standard user. You can see the preview of your AppSet by selecting "Show test
Endpoint Policy Manager when complete" within the Compilation tab, as shown in Figure 101

Then, when ready, switch to an administrative user to move the compiled Endpoint Policy Manager DLL
to

`c:\Program Files\PolicyPak\Extensions`

(or `c:\Program Files(x86)\PolicyPak\Extensions` on 64-bit machines) and use the Group Policy Editor
to see your completed AppSet.
