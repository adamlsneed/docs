# Configuration Data in VirtualStore

Sometimes, programs don't know that they are not allowed to store data in the protected Windows
locations. When a standard user runs the application and tries to change configuration data, the
application's configurations are not written to these protected Windows locations. They are
redirected or virtualized instead. In Figure 91, we can see that when the application tried to write
its data to `c:\Program Files`, it was actually redirected to

`%LocalAppData%\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader`.

This is a safety mechanism that Windows uses to allow applications to think that they've written
data to the desired location (`\Program Files`), when in actuality, the application's data was
really written to

`%appdata%\local\virtualstore\Program Files (x86)\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader`. However, there is
one problem with this: both 32-bit and 64-bit client machines could possibly be our targets. Because
of this, even though we're finding the file in

`%LocalAppData%\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader` (as shown in Figure
92), the data file could also be found on 32-bit machines in
`%LocalAppData%\VirtualStore\Program Files\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader` (as shown in Figure 93).

If you select a file within the VirtualStore directory, Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio
recognizes this and provides two features to ensure proper delivery to clients. First, as shown in
Figure 94, Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio will substitute the correct variable so it will work
on client machines of the same type.

Figure 94. Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio substituting the correct variable.

To account for the possibility that you might have both 32-bit and 64-bit machines as targets,
Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager, by default, will always try to write to both
locations on the target machine. That way, you're ensured that both 32-bit and 64-bit machines will
get your directives. Note that this behavior is controllable within Endpoint Policy Manager
`DesignStudio in Tools|Options `in the VirtualStore tab, as shown in Figure 95. It is recommended
that you keep this checkbox checked.

If you want to see both actions, you can click on the element's "Advanced" button, as shown in
Figure 96, and see the two actions created.

If you were to hover the mouse over each "File" location, you would see that the actions are set
against each possible file location automatically (`\Program Files(x86)` and `\Program Files`), one
for the first action and another for the second action, as shown in Figure 97 and Figure 98.

Therefore, there's really no downside in leaving the "Always create additional action when target
files utilize Windows 7 "VirtualStore" directories (recommended)" turned on. It will mean that your
64-bit and 32-bit applications will read the right file and be correctly configured.
