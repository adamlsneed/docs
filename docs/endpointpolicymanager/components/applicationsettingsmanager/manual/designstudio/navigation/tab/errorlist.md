# Error List

The Error List tab is only active after a compile error occurs (see Figure 57). Compile errors are
generally rare, and we request that you send any pXMLs which do not properly compile to
[support@endpointpolicymanager.com](mailto:support@endpointpolicymanager.com) for analysis.

When errors do occur, the error list pops up and suggests some fixes, as shown in Figure 58.
Double-click the proposed fix (or right-click and select "Apply Default Fix") for any errors found,
as shown in Figure 58.

If the errors are not corrected, send Endpoint Policy Manager technical support your pXML file for
analysis and a fix. We want to help! The email address is
