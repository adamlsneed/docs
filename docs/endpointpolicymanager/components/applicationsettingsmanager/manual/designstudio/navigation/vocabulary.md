# Vocabulary

Let's continue with a little vocabulary for working with Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio. All
your work takes place within the workspace. This is where your application is designed and modified
by you. A project is made up of forms, which almost always contain tabs. However, a form could be a
subdialog of an application's settings as well. Forms can also contain frames. Elements are the
items that you want to control in your target application. Elements can be directly on a tab, or
they can be contained within frames.

Your goal with Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio is to bring in as much of the applications' user
interface (UI) that you want to configure as possible. Then, you can use the DesignStudio to tweak
the design and configure each setting (see Figure 49.

Now that we've discussed vocabulary, we'll examine each item in DesignStudio to understand how it's
used to create AppSets.
