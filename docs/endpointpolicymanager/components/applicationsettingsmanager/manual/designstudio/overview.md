# DesignStudio

This document will help you to understand Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
DesignStudio. However, you should only use this document after you have read and worked through the
DesignStudio example in Book 3:

Application Settings Manager. We assume in this manual that you have already read that document and
can create simple AppSets.

This document is a reference guide for the rest of the DesignStudio utility and addresses some
advanced scenarios. We won't be using this guide to build any one specific AppSet. Rather, we will
move from application to application pointing out some tips, tricks, and quirks which might be
applicable to many scenarios while building AppSets.

Video: You may also wish to watch our DesignStudio videos, which cover some higher level details of
Endpoint Policy Manager: Application Manager >
[DesignStudio How-To](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/knowledgebase/applicationmanager/videolearningcenter/videolearningcenter.md).
