# Adding Space to Scrollable Panels

While editing your AppSets, you might want to put elements in a scrollable panel, or Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) DesignStudio might capture a scrollable panel that you
want to edit. In Figure 154, you can a frame being added with the "Frame" button.

Frames can be changed to scrollable panels by selecting the "Advanced" button, and then changing the
type to "Scrollable Panel" as shown in Figure 155.

When you do this, you'll see the frame convert to a scrollable panel, as shown in Figure 156.
DesignStudio will enter in some suggested values for the height and width of the panel; however, you
are able to modify them. For instance, if you want to make a tall panel, change the "Height" value
for more vertical space. You can also change the "Width" value and get more horizontal space. You
can see an example of how to do this in Figure 157.
