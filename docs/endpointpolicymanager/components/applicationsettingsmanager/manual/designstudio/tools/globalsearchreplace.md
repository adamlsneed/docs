# Global Search and Replace

Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio has a global search and replace function that can be accessed
from the Tools menu (or Ctrl+R), as shown in Figure 175.

In the example in Figure 176, we're replacing the text "JeremyM" (not case sensitive) with \* for
actions. You can use this to replace words within text or actions.
