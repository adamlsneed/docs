# Options

Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio has a variety of options you can configure. You can access
these options using Tools|Options, as shown in Figure 165. There are six tabs within Options:
Compilation, UI Capture, AppV (older versions of DesignStudio only), VirtualStore, Java, and Misc.
