# UI Capture Tab

The UI Capture tab has one checkbox, which is on by default (see Figure 167). When checked, captured
tabs will auto-size to the page and the other captured tabs. It is recommended to keep this checked
because, when unchecked, the captured tabs might not realign to the other tabs and fit the page.
