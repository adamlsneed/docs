# Using DesignStudio Tools

In this section, you'll learn how to do the following with Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) DesignStudio:

- Set up and configure Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio options (`Tools|Options`)
- Find unconfigured elements in our AppSet (`Tools|Show Elements List`)
- Perform a global search and replace for elements and text within our AppSet
  (`Tools|Global Search and Replace`)
- Merge AppSets (`Tools|PXML Merge Wizard`)
- Compile multiple AppSets at once (`Tools|Batch Compile`)
- Preview an existing AppSet (`Tools|Pak Preview`)

You can see the list of items from the Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio Tools menu in
Figure 164.
