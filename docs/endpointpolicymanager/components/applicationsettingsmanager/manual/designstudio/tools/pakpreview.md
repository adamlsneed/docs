# Pak Preview

You can use Pak Preview to edit any compiled AppSet in Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio or
capture additional tabs and configuration settings.  You can even do this for existing AppSets that
you have downloaded from the Endpoint Policy Manager Portal.  To do so, go to` Tools > Pak Preview`,
as shown in Figure 183.
