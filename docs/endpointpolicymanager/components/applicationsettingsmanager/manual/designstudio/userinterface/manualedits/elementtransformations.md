# Element Transformations

In this example, the application we want to manage is using a spinbox (also called an up/down box)
to set a value for a setting (see Figure 71).

However, occasionally Endpoint Policy Manager's Capture Wizard doesn't read this kind of element
correctly and it must be manually changed (see Figure 72).

DesignStudio will present the most logical transformations for you. In this example, DesignStudio
assumes you will likely want to transform the numeric edit box to a trackbar, up/down box, label, or
text box. However, you are also permitted to transform the element to any other type, as shown in
Figure 73. This would be an unusual transformation so it's tucked under "Advanced."

:::note
If you discover a transformation you need, but DesignStudio does not provide it, please
email [support@endpointpolicymanager.com](mailto:support@endpointpolicymanager.com), describe the scenario you need, and
indicate the application that you are trying to create an AppSet for (plus a screenshot if
possible).
