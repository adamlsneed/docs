# Capturing Subdialogs

Some applications have subdialogs you can capture. For instance, in the Control Panel mouse applet,
the ClickLock entry has a subdialog that's available to configure. That is, when you click its
"Settings" button, a "Settings for ClickLock" subdialog appears, as shown in Figure 78.

Now that you know this, you can capture this subdialog. To do this, in DesignStudio, double-click
the button. You will be asked if you want to convert the button to a subdialog, as shown in
Figure 79.

Click "Yes," and then click "OK," as shown in Figure 80. Next, open the subdialog you want to
capture, as shown in Figure 81.

Figure 81. Selecting the subdialog button.

Select the target window (the subdialog) to capture it. When the capture is complete, you'll see the
tab for the subdialog shown next to its parent tab, as shown in Figure 82.

You can click back and forth between the parent tab (Mouse Properties) and the subdialog (Settings
for ClickLock). Also, if you close the tab by clicking the X next to the subdialog, double-clicking
the button that represents the subdialog will open up that tab again.
