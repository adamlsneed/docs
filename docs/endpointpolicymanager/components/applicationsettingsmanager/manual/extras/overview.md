# Extras

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Application Settings Manager has some extra
management capabilities. In this section, we'll discuss the following features:

- Item-Level Targeting for an AppSet entry
- Internal Item-Level Targeting for the AppSet itself
- Creating multiple AppSets and changing priority
- Setting a comment or description about an AppSet's settings
- Adding "Managed by Endpoint Policy Manager" to applications under management
