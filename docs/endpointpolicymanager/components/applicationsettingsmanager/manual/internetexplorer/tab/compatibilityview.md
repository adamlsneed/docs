# Compatibility View Tab

Internet Explorer's Compatibility View tab lets you specify which websites go into a Compatibility
View mode. This tab is shown in Figure 34.

While at one time it was only possible to manage Compatibility View settings using Endpoint Policy
Manager Browser Router, you can now manage these settings using the Compatibility View tab in the
Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager IE AppSet.
