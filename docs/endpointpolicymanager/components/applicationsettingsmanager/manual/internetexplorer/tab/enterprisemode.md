Enterprise Mode (also known as Enterprise Compatibility Mode for IE 11) is a different method for IE
11 to specify which websites go into an enhanced compatibility rendering engine. The following are
helpful documents on IE Enterprise Mode:

Endpoint Policy Manager enables you to create Enterprise Compatibility lists on the fly without the
need for the following:

- Downloading extra tools
- Creating lists
- Saving files
- Creating multiple GPOs and pointing them to various lists
- Keeping lists up to date with their version numbers
- Knowing what versions of IE use the Enterprise v1 or v2 schema

In short, Endpoint Policy Manager IE AppSet makes this process easy. You use the Endpoint Policy
Manager Browser Router component and not the Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager
component, as shown in Figure 36.

Note that, as described in Microsoft's documentation
([http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn640699.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn640699.aspx)),
Enterprise Mode takes 65 seconds or a restart of IE the first time to see it take effect.
