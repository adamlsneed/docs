# Automatic Reapplication of Changes

**Step 1 –** Now, let's simulate what would happen if the user works around some set changes. In
this quick example, please manually uncheck "at least one lower case character (a-z)" and "at least
one upper case character (A-Z)." Then close WinZip.

**Step 2 –** Relaunch WinZip and reopen Options | Configuration. You will see that Endpoint Policy
Manager Application Settings Manager will redeploy the settings automatically. Endpoint Policy
Manager Application Settings Manager will reapply changes if the client is online (with network
connectivity) or offline (disconnected from the network).

Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager will silently, automatically reapply
application changes when the application is run. This is set automatically for all applications
under Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager by default, but can be changed. For more
information on Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager's automatic reapplication of
settings, see section, "Settings Delivery and Reinforcement Options" in the next major section.
