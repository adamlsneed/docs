# What happens to a application setting when the GPO falls out of scope?

By default, values for the application settings will remain as configured within the GPO.

By selecting "Revert this policy setting to the default value when it is no longer applied" the
default values contained with the original Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) s
are then applied.
