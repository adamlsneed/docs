# Is there an easy way to back up the GPO's I configured with Application Manager?

Backing up a Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) based GPO can be backed up the
same way as all other Group Policy Objects. Simply highlight the desired GPO itself in Group Policy
Management, right click and select Back Up. You can also highlight the Group Policy Objects
container node of all of your GPOs, right click and select Back Up All which will back up all of
your GPOs in one swipe.
