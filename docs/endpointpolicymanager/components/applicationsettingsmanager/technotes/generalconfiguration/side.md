# Should I create Endpoint Policy Application Manager policies on the USER or COMPUTER side?

It's really your choice where you want to apply the policy either on Computer or User side.

- When you apply policy on the User side, this user will get the setting wherever he or she goes.
- When you apply policy on Computer side, all the users logging into that computer will get the
  policy.

So it's really up to you.

Note that SOME Paks have "extra superpowers" which are only available on the COMPUTER side. Those
three special Paks are: Firefox, Java and Thunderbird.

We explain this in the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) On-Prem Manual.
