# How do I upgrade Application Manager when I upgrade my DCs / servers?

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) isn't "running" on any server.

Endpoint Policy Manager has three parts:

- MMC snap in for the GPMC.
- Data which resides within GPOs.
- CSE on target systems.

So, there's nothing to "move" or do if you decommission a DC or upgrade a server. If you were using
the Endpoint Policy Manager Central Store, that simply replicates when the next DC comes online.
