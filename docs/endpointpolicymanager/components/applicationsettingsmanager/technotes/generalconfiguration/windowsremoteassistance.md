# How-to gain access of a remote computer using built-in Windows Remote Assistance application?

Enable remote computers to accept the incoming remote connection with Netwrix Endpoint Policy
Manager (formerly PolicyPak)'s pre-configured PAK for Microsoft Remote Settings.

## Setting up a GPO to allow remote assistance using Endpoint Policy Application Manager.

In these steps, we will show steps for IT Administrators so they can Enable Remote Assistance for
end-users computers.

**Step 1 –** Launch Group Policy Management Console.

**Step 2 –** Right-click on a required OU and Create a new GPO.

**Step 3 –** Give the GPO a descriptive Name then click the OK button.

**Step 4 –** Right-click on the new GPO you just created, and select Edit option.

**Step 5 –** Expand the Endpoint Policy Manager node under Computer Configuration and select the
pre-configured PAK named "Endpoint Policy Manager for Microsoft Windows 7 and Later for System
Properties"

![686_7_image-20200330200932-4](/images/endpointpolicymanager/applicationsettings/686_7_image-20200330200932-4.webp)

**Step 6 –** Right-click on the PAK entry and select the Properties option.

![686_9_image-20200330200932-5](/images/endpointpolicymanager/applicationsettings/686_9_image-20200330200932-5.webp)

**Step 7 –** Select the Remote tab, and select the checkbox "Allow Remote Assistance connections to
this computer" and then click the OK button.

**Step 8 –** Lastly, run `GPUPDATE` on end-users computers to apply the policy immediately, or wait
for the policy to apply during the normal group policy refresh interval.

Additional Recommendations: Use Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts Manager and create two additional
computer side policy items.

**Step 1 –** Set Firewall to Allow Remote Assistance:

Using Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts Manager you can execute the following script to open a
Firewall for incoming remote assistance connections.

- netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="remote assistance" new enable=Yes

**Step 2 –** Proactively address possible issue with `MSRA.EXE` and `PPAppLockdr64.dll`:

Using Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts Manager you can execute the following script to configure
custom Exploit Protection settings for Microsoft Remote Assistance (`MSRA.EXE`).

```
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name msra.exe -Enable DisableExtensionPoints
```

You can create two separate policy items:

![686_14_image-20201016162349-4](/images/endpointpolicymanager/applicationsettings/686_14_image-20201016162349-4.webp)

Or you can combine both policies in one if you prefer:

![686_15_image-20201016162040-3](/images/endpointpolicymanager/applicationsettings/686_15_image-20201016162040-3.webp)
