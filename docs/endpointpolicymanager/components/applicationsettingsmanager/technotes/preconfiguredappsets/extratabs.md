# Chrome: Why do I have extra tabs appear when I open Chrome on an endpoint?

Be sure to find the Set Pages area and uncheck "Always reapply this setting" in the remaining tabs.
Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) is delivering "blank" when the "Always reapply
this setting" is present upon items. So right-click and uncheck each unwanted page as seen here.
