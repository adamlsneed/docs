# Chrome: Why Homepage button URL is not working for Google Chrome?

Show Home Button is set and URL is configured to be shown when pressing the home button. But it did
not work even if its sets that way.

The home page type can either be set to a URL you specify or set to the New Tab Page. If you select
the New Tab Page, then this policy does not take effect.

For Home Button URL to work, check and uncheck Use New Tab Page as homepage setting like shown in
