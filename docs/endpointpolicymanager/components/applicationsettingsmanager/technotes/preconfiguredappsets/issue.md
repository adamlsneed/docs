# HowTo: What do I do if I find a problem with a preconfigured AppSet?

While you are welcome to contact Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) support
concerning any issues with our preconfigured AppSets, we can recommend some steps to perform before
doing that.

We encourage customers to take an active role if a Preconfigured AppSet appears to have some issue
in the definition. This is why we provide the Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio to customers – to
make and update settings for their own AppSets, or update our preconfigured AppSets.

That being said, if you identify a pre-configured AppSet issue, here is our step-by-step
recommendation:

- Ensure you are using the latest Endpoint Policy Manager CSE and latest AppSet. If you are unsure
  of what the latest build is of Endpoint Policy Manager, post to the support forums, email support,
  or ask your sales person.

If that doesn't work:

- Post a message to our support forums (customers and all trial users have access.)
- Narrow down the issue and help us understand what the AppSet is or is not doing.
- Provide screenshots and logs
- See if the community has a known fix for it and/or others can replicate the same problem.
- Use the Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio manuals and tool to help yourself and fix your own
  AppSet definition issue. (And, please report your fix so we can update the AppSet for the future.)

If you don't want try to fix a AppSet definition yourself, we (Endpoint Policy Manager Software tech
support) will try to analyze and remediate and AppSet issue if possible, knowing that it might take
some time (or might not be possible at all.)

The more you can isolate the problem using the troubleshooting procedures outlined in the Endpoint
Policy Manager manuals, the better we can serve you.

The preconfigured AppSets are examples we (Endpoint Policy Manager Software) provide the community
for free.

Our company is based around a community model where we all help each other.  You will find that the
Endpoint Policy Manager user community is a true asset.
