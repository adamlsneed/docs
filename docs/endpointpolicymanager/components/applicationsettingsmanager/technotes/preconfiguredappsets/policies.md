# Chrome Policies don't appear to work when using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

Chrome's POLICIES are supported only when machines are domain joined.

If your machine is NON-domain joined when used with PPCloud .. which is a typical case,  
Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Application Manager settings cannot be
delivered to Chrome.

We are working on a workaround in the future, but at this time, there is no workaround unless the
machine is domain joined.
