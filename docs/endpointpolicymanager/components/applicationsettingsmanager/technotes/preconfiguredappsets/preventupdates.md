# Firefox: How can I prevent both automatic AND manual updates for Firefox?

If you use the Firefox Pak for Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak), and perform the
steps as follows:

- Firefox Pak must be on Computer side and affect computers.
- Then click "Never check for updates"
- AND perform "System wide lockdown" as seen here

Then the result is that Firefox FORBIDS both automatic updated AND manual updates as well as seen
