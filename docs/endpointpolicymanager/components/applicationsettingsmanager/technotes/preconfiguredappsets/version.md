# Firefox: What versions of the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE support managing certificates in what versions of Firefox?

Here is a table to help you understand what is supported.

Note that Firefox versions not listed on this table are not yet tested and may or may not work

The reason you need to upgrade the CSE to support the various levels of Firefox is because the
Firefox methods for accepting certificates changed, and therefore we changed with them to support
the changes.
