# AppSets: How will I know that an existing AppSet will work with the version of the application I have today (and tomorrow)?

It is a fact of the software business that new application versions are constantly being released. 
Most of the time, however, a AppSet that worked in an application "yesterday" will continue to work
"today" and "tomorrow."

For instance, our FireFox Appset works with all versions of the popular web browser whether it be
version 3 or 17 or whatever's next.

Rarely will a pre-configured AppSet completely stop working when a vendor updates their
application.  But it does happen. Most of the time one of the following scenarios applies:

- An application adds a couple of additional configuration settings.  By using the Netwrix Endpoint
  Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Design Studio, you can easily capture the new settings then,
  copy and paste these new settings into the existing AppSet.
- The application changes internally.  Again, using Design Studio is a straightforward process to
  find the new setting value locations and apply them to the new AppSet.
- Every once and a while, the application is truly re-architected and in these circumstances, a new
  AppSet must be created.

As a Endpoint Policy Manager customer, you get more than just a powerful software engine that allows
you to manage and lockdown applications for your users.

You get the Design Studio that allows you to update and create AppSets yourself.  You also get
access to our powerful user-based community, providing you a knowledge base and peer group to turn
to ask questions and request advice, and of course, you have access to our committed support staff.
