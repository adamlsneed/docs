# How to use Scripts Manager to workaround the "PPAppLockdr64.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error" message when running Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA.exe) and the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE is installed on Windows 10 1903

**Step 1 –** Create the Scripts Manager policy in PolicyPak.

**Step 2 –** Run the Microsoft Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) as a user with the necessary
rights (to create and link GPOs at that level) and then create a new GPO and link the GPO at the OU
(User Level) or Domain level depending on who needs to receive these settings.

For example:

2. Next Edit the newly created GPO and expand the User Configuration > PolicyPak > Scripts Manager
   section.
3. Then click "ADD NEW COLLECTION" to add a new collection, give it any descriptive name you like,
   then click "OK".

![280_3_image-20191015113622-5](/images/endpointpolicymanager/troubleshooting/applicationsettings/280_3_image-20191015113622-5.webp)

4. Next, double click on the collection you just created to open the collection.
5. Then right-click anywhere in the right pane and choose "Add > New Policy", (or alternatively
   click on the "ADD NEW POLICY" button) to create a new policy item within the collection.

![280_4_image-20191015113622-6](/images/endpointpolicymanager/troubleshooting/applicationsettings/280_4_image-20191015113622-6.webp)

6. The "PolicyPak Scripts Manager Wizard" will then open.
7. At the "On apply action" screen choose "PowerShell script" from the drop down.
8. Then paste the commands below into the scripts body window.

   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy-ScopeProcess-ExecutionPolicyBypass-Force
   Set-ProcessMitigation -Name msra.exe -Enable DisableExtensionPoints
   ```

9. Then check both the "Run script as user" and "With elevated rights" boxes at the bottom left hand
   of the window and click "Next".
10. Click "Next" to skip the "On revert action" screen.
11. At the "Specify process mode" screen choose "Once or when forced" then click "Save"

**Step 3 –** Lastly, test the policy.

1. Log in as a domain user within the OU or Domain where the policy is applied and verify under
   Windows Settings that the custom Exploit Protection settings are present.
