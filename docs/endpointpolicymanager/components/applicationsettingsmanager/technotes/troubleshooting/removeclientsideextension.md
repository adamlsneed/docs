# Are there any caveats about removing the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE after it is deployed?

Here are the caveats about removing the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) CSE.

Scenario 1: You manually remove the CSE while a user affected by Endpoint Policy Manager directives
is installed. However, other users (on the same machine) also have existing Endpoint Policy Manager
directives.

Result: Only the user which is currently logged will have his settings revert back. The rest of the
users will not have his settings reverted back.

Scenario 2: You automatically remove the CSE using some kind of software management system.

Result: It's possible that no users will have his settings revert back because there could be no one
logged in at the time of the revocation of the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE.

Scenario 3: You are delivering settings to App-V, ThinApp, or other supported application
virtualization technology.

Result: In no cases are these settings reverted back when the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE is
removed.

Note in all cases, after the CSE is removed the following will occur:

- Endpoint Policy Manager will not accept any Endpoint Policy Manager directives within GPOs or via
  files-based (MSI) delivery.
- Endpoint Policy Manager will no longer provide UI lockdown. All graying and hiding and tab
  lockouts will become un-locked.
- Endpoint Policy Manager will revert any ACL Lockdown. Users will be able to modify settings
  directly again inside the registry and files.
- Endpoint Policy Manager will no longer re-apply any settings during login, Group Policy refresh,
  PPupdate
- Endpoint Policy Manager will no longer re-apply any settings when the application is re-launched,
  in the background or when the computer is offline.
