# A ThinApp throws an "Exception Error". What can I do to fix it?

If you encounter the following error (or something like it) when launching a ThinApp packaged
application, there is a workaround.

![242_1_image001-2](/images/endpointpolicymanager/troubleshooting/error/applicationsettings/242_1_image001-2.webp)

You can fully isolate PolicyPak from trying to manage a specific ThinApp application, thus working
around the exception error.

To do this, you'll need to re-package your application. However, before you click to make it a
package, first create a folder in the Thin App Package to the location of where the CSE exists.

So %ProgramFilesDir%PolicyPakApplication ManagerClient then add a new file named ATTRIBUTES.INI and
set the file to:

[Isolation]
DirectoryIsolationMode=FULL

What this does is exclude the PolicyPak CSE files from interacting with the ThinApp application EXE.

:::tip
Remember, This prevents PolicyPak from managing that application, but, works around any Exception
Errors on launch.
