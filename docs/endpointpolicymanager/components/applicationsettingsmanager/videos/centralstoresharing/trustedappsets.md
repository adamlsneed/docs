# Endpoint Policy Manager Application Setting Manager (Understanding Trusted AppSets)

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Application Settings Manager now ships signed
AppSets from Netwrix. This means that all the DLLs (AppSets) we ship are digitally signed and
unaltered and you know they came from us. Watch this video to understand how to take advantage of
this feature.
