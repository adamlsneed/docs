# How do I use Least Privilege Manager to Elevate .reg files to allow import by standard users

The registry requires elevated rights to be updated. Least Privilege Manager can be used to elevate
the rights of a standard user to allow specific .reg files be imported without an administrator.

:::note
We recommend you put the .REG file on a server so the file itself is under permissions
which cannot be tampered with. It could be a risk to put the .REG file locally on the hard drive
where anyone could edit the raw contents.

**Step 2 –** Expand Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) node on either Computer, or

## Method 2: New Script Policy

Before you create the policy, place your script on a server or secure, shared location (e.g.
`\\server\share\PSscript.ps1`). The following is a sample script that can be used with either
PowerShell or as a batch file to import a `.REG` file:

```
Regedit.exe /s \\server\share\NewRegValue.reg
```

**Step 1 –** Create new GPO where required.

**Step 2 –** Expand PolicyPak node on either Computer or User Configuration side and click on
.**Least Privilege Manager**.

**Step 3 –** Create new SCRIPT Policy (a or b).

**Step 4 –** Select **Use Combo Rule …** and click **Next**.

:::note
Although you can use a simple rule and simply use path as the qualifying factor, for
security purposes it is recommended you have multiple qualifying factors.

:::note
If you make changes to the script, the Hash value will need to be updated for the policy
to remain valid. Alternatively, if you digitally sign your script, Signature can be used instead of
Hash as the second method of validation.
