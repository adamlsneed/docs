# FTK Imager crashes with 'Server Busy' dialog box when "Image Mounting" while running elevated

When attempting to mount an image with an elevated "FTK Imager" application, a "Server Busy"
dialogue box will present itself a moment after starting to browse for the image.

When this appears, the only way to get out of this is to end the task through Task Manager.

## The Fix

To get around this error, we need to deselect the **Don't elevate Open/Save** dialog option when
creating the elevation policy for the application **FTK Imager**. This is selected by default on all
new policies.

This checked by default to prevent users from gaining unauthorized administrative rights through the
Open/Save dialog box to their endpoint. Unchecked, you open up the possibility for a knowledgeable
operator to gain administrative access to the computer. For more information in this, please refer
to this KB video
->[Increase security by reducing rights on Open/Save dialogs](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/bestpractices/opensavedialogs.md)

## Optional

In this case, to limit the rights the end-user could take advantage of, when the Open/Save dialog
box option is deselected, changing the Action to **Run with customized token** allows you to reduce
the integrity level of the process, thereby reducing the rights given to the process and, by
extension, the end-user.

Under Token, set the Base Token to **Always create and use an elevated token** and Integrity level
to **Medium-plus**. This will allow the application to run as desired, but not give access to the
end-user to change system files.
