# How to create an LPM Policy for (SynTPEnh.exe) Synaptics Pointing Device Driver

Problem: The application Synaptics Pointing Device Driver (SynTPEnh.exe) is reported by the Global
Settings (Audit) policy in the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Event log as
needing elevation.

SynTPEnh.exe does not actually need to be elevated, but since it is considered a driver it is
assumed to require elevation.

To work around this issue you should use **Allow and log** instead of **Run with elevated
privileges** when creating a Least Privilege Manager rule for this application to pass safely
through SecureRun.

:::note
This policy (SYNAPTICS-Allow-AND-log.xml ) is provided in the

download, and can be found in the extracted contents under the PolicyPak Least Privilege Manager
XMLs folder.
