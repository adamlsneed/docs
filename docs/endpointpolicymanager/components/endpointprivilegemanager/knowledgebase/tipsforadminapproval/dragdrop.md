# I elevated an application, but drag and drop between the elevated and other non-elevated applications isn't working anymore. What can I try?

When Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) elevates a process it also changes its
Integrity level.

As such, a newly elevated process may not be able to communicate with a normally running process.

That being said, you can reduce the Integrity level of the process which is running elevated. To do
it, instead of selecting **Run with elevated privileges**, choose instead **Run with customized
token**.

This enables you to change the Integrity level. You'll want to try Medium-High first, then fall back
to Medium or Low, stopping at the first one which works.
