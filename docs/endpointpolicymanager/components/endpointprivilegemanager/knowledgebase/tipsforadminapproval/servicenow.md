# How can I integrate Endpoint Privilege Manager and Servicenow (or any other help desk) via email?

Please consider watching this video before continuing:
[Using Email / Long Codes](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/adminapproval/longcodes.md)

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) doesn't have an API integration with
Servicenow, but you can make a nice workflow with Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager
and ServiceNow or whatever help desk system you are using.

Basically, you configure Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager's Email Admin Approval
method to go to your inbox of Servicenow.

Then have someone on your Service desk use the Admin Approval tool to generate the response. Click @
in the tool to automatically create the email. The only thing that needs to be entered in is the TO:
field.

Additionally, if you want to give your end-users tips on what to do, you can add URL links which
appear like this to the end user.

Setting this up is as easy as specifying a URL for them to click upon in the Custom message location
in the Admin Approval policy.
