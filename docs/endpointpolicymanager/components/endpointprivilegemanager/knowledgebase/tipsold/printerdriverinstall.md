# How to elevate Print driver installation using Endpoint Privilege Manager? (alternate method)

These directions should only be performed if asked by support. The normal method to elevate print
driver installation is to use the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Helper tools.
The following videos provide you with step by step instructions:

Printui.dll is the executable file that contains the functions to install a Print driver. Currently
Endpoint Policy Manager can elevate a Control Panel applet, and it can be `.CPL` or `.DLL` files.
But we cannot elevate a` .DLL` file alone.

In this KB we will demonstrate how a non-admin user can install a print driver on its own, by
elevating a` rundll32.exe` process using `PPLPM`.

Using Endpoint Policy Manager , elevate the `rundll32.exe`, and include a command-line argument to
elevate a specific DLL. Just like shown in below screenshot.

Rule to elevate` rundll32.exe` by PATH and COMMAND LINE (when `rundll32.exe `runs a `DLL`, the
`DLL `path is specified on the command line)
