# When Endpoint Policy Manager SecureRun(TM) is turned on, PowerShell won't run. How can I re-enable this?

You need to use EXE Policy with rule Allow and log for
Powershell.[ Go to https://www.endpointpolicymanager.com/pp-files/allow-powershell.php](https://www.endpointpolicymanager.com/pp-files/allow-powershell.php)
and import it to enable PowerShell to run with SecureRun enabled.
