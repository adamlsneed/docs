- Path – The name of the file and/or the location. This is the least secure method so use it with
  caution. You may also provide a folder or folder recursively.
- Hash — This is bound to change from time to time, so use sparingly.
- Signature — Digitally signed items about the package which are difficult to forge.

You can see the dialogs for Path, Hash and Signature condition here:
