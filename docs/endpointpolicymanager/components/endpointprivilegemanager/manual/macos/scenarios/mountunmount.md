You can perform the following functions:

Operations:

- Mount — Operations for mounting USB devices and dmg files
- Unmount — Operations for unmounting/ejecting USB devices and dmg disk images
- Apply to any device — Automatically apply to all USB disk devices and DMG files

Device Types:

- USB — USB disk devices are supported
- DMG — DMG files are supported as mounted devices

Action:

- Deny Execution — Block the specified device type
- Allow Execution —Allow attachment of specified device type
- Elevate — Lets users perform operations with elevated privileges without entering an admin
  password

Targets:

- Path — Path to DMG file to mount it
- Sources — Mount point defined by the system by USB device name or DMG file name

For a simple demo, let's Block All USB and DMG devices.
