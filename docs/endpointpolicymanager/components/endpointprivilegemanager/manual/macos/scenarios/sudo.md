# SUDO

:::note
See the
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud and SUDO support](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/macintegration/sudosupport.md)
video and the
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Mac + SUDO Using Wildcard Example](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/macintegration/wildcards.md)
video for an overview of this section.
:::


The point of SUDO policies is to enable a standard user to perform SUDO commands without needing to
provide actual admin credentials. In this example the user wants to perform the command

```
Sudo mkdir /Users/Sudo/test1 but is blocked with a password request.
```

To overcome this, create a SUDO rule like this one:

The Actions are:

- Deny Execution — Blocks the running of matching SUDO commands
- Allow Execution — Running SUDO commands is limited according to the system configuration. The
  PolicyPak MacOS client logs the user's actions
- Elevate — SUDO commands run without administrator password request, applicable for admin and
  standard users.

For this example policy, choose **Elevate**.

After the policy is synced, the result on the client can be seen here, where the same command now
runs without password requirement.
