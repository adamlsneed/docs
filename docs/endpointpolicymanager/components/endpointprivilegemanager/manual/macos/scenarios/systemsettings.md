# System Settings Policy

:::note
See the
[Endpoint Policy Manager for Mac / Least Priv Manager: System Settings policy](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/macintegration/systemsettings.md)
video for an overview of this section.

Standard Users are prompted when they access System Settings in MacOS. For instance, trying to
modify Date&Time or Wi-Fi settings prompts standard users for admin credentials.

System Settings Policy enables you to:

- Deny Execution — Stop access to a System Settings
- Allow Execution —  Operates in accordance with the system configurations (Endpoint Policy Manager
  client logs actions)
- Elevate — Standard user can perform the operation where it would normally not be allowed.

In this example, we are permitting a Standard User to overcome restricted access to Date&Time and
Wi-Fi System Settings.

Without Endpoint Policy Manager policy, the system asks for administrator confirmation to change
system settings for the standard user. With Endpoint Policy Manager you are able to provide the
ability to change settings without administrator involvement.
