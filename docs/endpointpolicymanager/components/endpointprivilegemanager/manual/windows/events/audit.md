# Creating Policy from Audit Event

Once you have generated events and store them locally or forward them to a service, you can
automatically create rules from events.

If you are using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud you can store events from endpoints and then
automatically transition those events to rules. See the
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud + PPLPM + Events: Collect Events in the Cloud](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/eventing/cloudevents.md)
video for additional information.

If you have stored Windows events, you can use the details from those events to make rules using the
MMC snap-in.

:::note
See the
[Auto-Create Policy from Global Audit event](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/eventing/globalauditevent.md)video
for a demonstration of this.
