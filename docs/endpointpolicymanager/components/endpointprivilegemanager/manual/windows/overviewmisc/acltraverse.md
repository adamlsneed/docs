# Understanding ACL Manage File System and Registry (ACL Traverse)

Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager enables Standard Users to perform operations in the
file system or registry where they would not normally have access. To do this, youâ€™ll assign a
process which, when run, will determine which operations can be performed on a file or portion of
the registry.

Start out by creating a rule. In this case we want to specify an application process, like Notepad,
to perform an operation like Write the HOSTS file.

First specify the process match and signify you want to perform **ACL manage file system and
registry**.

Next, specify the path(s) to files or registry and change the Permission (using the dropdown or
**Edit permissions** button.)

As a result, when Notepadis run from the specified location it can edit the
`c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` file.
