# Understanding Re-authentication & Justification Text

There might be times you want users to re-authenticate and/or provide justification text about their
actions. Justification text is logged to the local event log for later review.

Here, on the left youâ€™ll see a Self Elevate rule, and on the right a standard Elevation rule.

You can see both rule types have the options for **Require Justification Text** and **Force user to
reauthenticate**.
