# Getting Started: Client

If you already have the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) CSE installed on your
desired endpoint, great! That’s it, you’re done. However, in the Netwrix Privilege Secure download,
you will also find the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) CSE available within the
Netwrix Privilege Secure download as a courtesy.

Therefore, you may use either the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) CSE found
either within the Netwrix Privilege Secure download, or the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) CSE found in the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) download.

:::note
See the
[Netwrix Privilege Secure Client - Getting Started with MMC with/without Endpoint Policy Manager ](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/netwrixprivilegesecure/privilegesecure.md)video
for a demo on the relationship of the Netwrix Privilege Secure and Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) downloads and their moving parts.
:::


:::warning
It might be best to use the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) CSE
download since the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) CSE download may have
bugfixes, etc., which may not yet be available in the Netwrix Privilege Secure download due to lag
time.
:::


:::note
The interaction between Netwrix Privilege Secure and Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) CSE does notneed to be licensed. When you evaluate or purchase Netwrix
Privilege Secure, the major Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Least Privilege
Manager management and elevation functions are automatically available to you without needing to
install any specific endpoint license.
:::


- The Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Least Privilege Manager directives which
  are distributed as part ofNetwrix Privilege Secure server performing the brokering\*will work even
  if unlicensed.
- The Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) specific items where there is no Netwrix
  Privilege Secure server involved require a license.

You can see the difference in the list view as seen here.

In the next section we will see how to create Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) +
Netwrix Privilege Secure policies which will not need an endpoint license to work out of the box.
Again, the idea is that you are already paying for an Netwrix Privilege Secure license, and because
Netwrix Privilege Secure is involved in the policy, those policies work on the endpoint for free.
