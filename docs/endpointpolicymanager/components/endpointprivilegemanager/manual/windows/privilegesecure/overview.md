# Endpoint Policy Manager & Netwrix Privilege Secure

The Endpoint Policy Manager CSE is the agent for Netwrix Privilege Secure. When paired together, you
get the following benefits:

- You are able to launch applications (elevated or not) from a local desktop, and have them brokered
  by the Netwrix Privilege Secure server
- Applications will launch with Netwrix Privilege Secure 2fa (built-in or 3rd party)
- Applications may launch elevated if desired
- The whole screen can be recorded and sent up to the Netwrix Privilege Secure server for
  safekeeping and analysis

Therefore, instead of relying on RDP to remote control into a server to perform a privileged
operation, maintaining a second set of credentials, and having nothing recorded for posterity, you
can use the Better Together power of Netwrix Privilege Secure and Endpoint Policy Manager CSE.

The best part is, if you are only interested in the Endpoint Policy Manager + Netwrix Privilege
Secure Better Together story, you only have to pay for the Netwrix Privilege Secure licenses. That
is, there is no required endpoint license when Netwrix Privilege Secure is used alongside a Endpoint
Policy Manager directive (where Netwrix Privilege Secure is involved.) You will see more as we go
along but, if you are using Netwrix Privilege Secure and want to try out the power of Endpoint
Policy Manager, that is included in your Netwrix Privilege Secure license.
