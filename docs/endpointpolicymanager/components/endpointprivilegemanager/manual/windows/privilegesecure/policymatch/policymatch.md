# Credential Based Policy Match

Credential Based Policy Match takes a matching process and uses Netwrix Privilege Secure to act on
another user’s behalf. In this example we will launch `NotepadP.exe` as `EastSalesUser1`,
but Netwrix Privilege Secure will broker the connection and actually launch the process as
`EastSalesAdmin9` from Active Directory.
