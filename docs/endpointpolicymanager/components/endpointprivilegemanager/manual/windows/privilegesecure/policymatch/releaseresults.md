To see the action, right-click on the application and choose **Run with Netwrix Privilege Secure**
(or double-click it if the **Apply on demand** option was unchecked.

Youâ€™ll launch the process as `EastSalesUser1`, and give your Active Directory credentials,
Two-Factor (brokered by Netwrix Privilege Secure) and wait for the Activity Session to be created.

The result is that NotepadP is launched as `EastSalesAdmin9`. Because Netwrix Privilege Secure is
brokering the operation and the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Least Privilege
Manager client is changing the context to that user.
