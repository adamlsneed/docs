  activity.

  activity.
- Activity name – Nothing to enter when Credential Release / always grayed out.

At the end of the policy you have some settings for **Action** and **Options**.

In **Action**, you can select **Run with elevated privileges** or simply Allow and log if you just
want it brokered.

In **Options**, you can have the application launch be exclusively called with a right click **Run
with Netwrix Privilege Secure** context menu, or always call Netwrix Privilege Secure with **Apply
on demand** unchecked. Additionally, you can enable or disable video recording when this policy is
issued via **Enable video recording (Netwrix Privilege Secure)**.

Back on the Netwrix Privilege Secure server, you need to make sure there is a matching **Credential
Based** policy.
