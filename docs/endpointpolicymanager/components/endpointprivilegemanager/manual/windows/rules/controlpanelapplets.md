Next, consider a situation in which a Standard User may need access to the Device Manager and the
Disk Defragmenter Control Panel applets. Make two policies (going through the wizard twice). The
first time choose **Device Manager** first, as shown here. Next, select **Run with elevated
privileges** as the action.

At this point, GPupdate can be run and tested on the endpoint. You should bypass the UAC prompt and
