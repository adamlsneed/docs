# Run with Customized Token

On rare occasions you might need to change some of the attributes of a process’ token instead of a
blanket Elevate. You may do this via the **Run with customized token** function when creating a
rule.

Here you can change a variety of functions about the token including its permissions, privileges and
security, as well as Integrity level.

The common use cases for needing to manage a customized token are:

- Handling service accounts’ permissions.For more in formation, see the
  [Reduce or specify Service Account Rights](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/bestpractices/serviceaccountrights.md)
  video demonstration.
- Drag-and-drop issues between applications. For ore information, see the
