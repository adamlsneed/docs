# Denying DLLs within Applications

You can deny DLLs within Applications, like PowerShellâ€™s internal DLLs, which make it operate.

First you must turn on the option with a Global DLL policy, which may only be enabled on the
**Computer Configuration** side.

Then create a matching rule with **New DLL Policy**.
