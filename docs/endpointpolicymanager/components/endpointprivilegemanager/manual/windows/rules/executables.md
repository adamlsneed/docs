# Elevating Executables

:::note
For an overview of how to elevate applications that need admin rights, see the
[Kill Local Admin Rights (Run applications with Least Privilege)](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/basicsandgettingstarted/localadminrights.md)
video.
:::


In the previous section, we observed that when a Standard User tries to run Process Monitor, they
are not allowed because it requires admin rights. Creating a Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege
Manager policy and getting it delivered will remedy this.

In these examples we’ll be using Group Policy to create the policies and then delivering them.
However, you may also use Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, and MDM service like Intune, or your own
system like SCCM.

For these examples, you must link it to where users are and create a new executable policy. As shown
in this example, create a GPO named PPLPM Policies and link it to the East Sales Users
organizational unit (OU). Then in the **User Configuration** > Netwrix Privilege Secure > **Least
Privilege Manager** section, select **Add** > **New Executable Policy**.

An executable rule can be one of two types:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/elevate/elevating_executables_1.webp)

Simple rules match on a specific piece of criteria, which could include the name or location (Path),
the fingerprint of the file (Hash), the company that digitally signed the file (Signature), or
specific characteristics of a file such as version and inner name (File Info).

Combo rules enable matching on any or all the mentioned criteria. A popular combination is file name
and publisher. You can make specific rules about the items you want to enable with elevated rights
by using two conditions.

You’ll then be asked if you want this policy to be related to an action within Netwrix Privilege
Secure. For now, we’ll skip this (leave unchecked) and we’ll return back to it in the
[Endpoint Policy Manager & Netwrix Privilege Secure](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/manual/windows/privilegesecure/overview.md)
topic. Future examples will purposely omit this step until we need it.

In this case, use a Hash condition, which indicates, "Run ProcMon.exe with elevated rights because
of the Hash (fingerprint) of the file." Select **Hash** and click **Next**.

Additionally, this is where you set the settings for **Apply to child processes**. For now, leave
as-is. You can learn more about this in ” in the section on“Best Practices and Miscellaneous
Topics.”

Specify a file (in this example, we'll use the copy of Process Monitor) or a running process (which
is not applicable in this scenario), as shown here.  The hash is populated and you may choose which
Algorithm to use.

The next screen, as shown here, demonstrates possible action types and options for Endpoint Policy
Manager Least Privilege Manager.

These action types are:

- **Run with elevated privileges**. This adds the SYSTEM token to the process, elevating it as
  needed when a Standard User runs it.
- **Run with customized token**. This is not usually needed but provides granular control of tokens
  in processes.
- **ACL Manage file system and registry** You can enable specific files or registry items to be
  managed when specific processes are run.
- **Deny execution**. This prevents something from running even if the user is an admin.
- **Allow and log**. This enables an application to run if otherwise prevented. When used in
  conjunction with SecureRun™, this can be useful. The next section and example will explore this
  in greater detail.

These Options are:

- **Apply on demand**. Enables the elevation only when application is right-clicked. For more
  information on this, see [Apply on Demand Rules](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/manual/windows/apply/ondemand.md).
- **Do not generate events**. PolicyPak logs items in the Windows event log. Setting this item
  configured (checked) means that events will not be logged when this process is run.
- **Do not elevate Open/Save dialog**. By default Endpoint Policy Manager will prevent child
  processes from gaining elevation thru the Open/Save dialogs. See the
  [Best Practices and Miscellaneous Topics](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/manual/windows/overviewmisc/overviewmisc.md) topic for additional
  information.
- **Show popup message**. Optional requirement to either force the user to reauthenticate and/or put
  in Justification text before the process starts. See the
  [Best Practices and Miscellaneous Topics](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/manual/windows/overviewmisc/overviewmisc.md) for additional
  information.

The next page provides the opportunity to enhance this policy with these final touches:

- **Name**
- **Comment**
- **State** (default is enabled)
- **Scope**. See the [Best Practices and Miscellaneous Topics](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/manual/windows/overviewmisc/overviewmisc.md) for
  additional information.
- **Item-Level Targeting**. See the
  [Best Practices and Miscellaneous Topics](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/manual/windows/overviewmisc/overviewmisc.md) for additional
  information.
- **Parent Process filter**. See the
  [Best Practices and Miscellaneous Topics](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/manual/windows/overviewmisc/overviewmisc.md) for additional
  information.

Once you have made your selections, an entry in the Group Policy Management Editor is obtained, as
shown in here.

To re-edit the policy, it is not necessary to use the wizard again. Instead, just double-click the
policy entry to view it in a flat list, as shown here. Then click on any of the numbered items to
make any changes.

On your endpoint, log on as the user who will obtain the GPO (e.g., EastSalesUser1), or run
GPupdate. Once the GPO applies, Process Monitor will run without a UAC prompt, as demonstrated here.
