# SecureRun and Inline Commands

By default PolicyPak SecureRun will also block “inline commands.”

For example, one can run something like this from the Run dialog (or in many other ways.)

```
cmd /c "mkdir C:\TEST & copy c:\Windows\notepad.exe C:\TEST"
```

Normally, users don’t do this. But it could be valid during an application installation or program
setup. You can see an example of this used in the Microsoft

article.

SecureRun will automatically try to block such attempts. For more information on how to deal wit
this issue, please see

for guidance and details.
