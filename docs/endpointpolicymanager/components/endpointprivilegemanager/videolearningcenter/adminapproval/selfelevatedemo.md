# Self Elevate Mode

Use PPLPM Self Elevate mode to overcome UAC prompts without requiring specific rules. This is useful
if you want to take away local admin rights, but still give users the ability to "break the glass"
if they have an emergency. This technique isn't generally recommended due to a potential lowering of
your security posture, but it can be very useful for the right circumstances.
