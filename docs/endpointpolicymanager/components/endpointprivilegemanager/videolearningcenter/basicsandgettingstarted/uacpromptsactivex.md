# Overcome UAC prompts for Active X controls

Got standard users, but they cannot install their own ActiveX Controls? Yeah you still have IE and
you still have Active X controls. So Manage that situation with Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak). See how easy it is to get those ActiveX controls installed with rules ... with
Endpoint Policy Manager !
