# Automatically Prevent 6210 and 6215 Events from Known Good Identities

When Endpoint Policy Manager SecureRun is not enabled, it will automatically generate 6210 events
for non-trusted items and 6215 events for non-signed items. A new feature in Endpoint Policy Manager
Global Settings policies enables you exempt out known good identities (like a user or group) from
generating 6210 and/or 6215 events before SecureRun is turned on. Configure known good identities
before turning on SecureRun to know what to expect before SecureRun is used.
