Policies**. Once there you are prompted by the Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager for Windows
wizard.

Here you can select an install rule, an uninstall rule, or a mixed rule.

- Install Rule provides a method to install features or optional features.
- Uninstall Rule provides a method to uninstall features or optional features.
- Mixed Rule provides methods both installing and uninstalling.

For this example, select **Install Rule**, which brings you to the **Select package type** page.

The next screen allows you to turn on Windows features. Select the items you want, such as .Net
Framework 3.5 (either, both, or neither of the sub-options) as well as the Telnet Client.
Additionally you should take note of some special items:

- Supported on - Explains which versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server this item will apply to.
- Feature details - Explains which features depend on the selected feature (and will automatically
  be installed), as well as whether a reboot is required or possible.

Click **Next** to continue. Then, click on **Add policies to the existing collection**.

![quickstart_adding_and_removing_6](/images/endpointpolicymanager/feature/addremove/quickstart_adding_and_removing_6.webp)

In The Policies settings window shows which policy items you are about to create. You can optionally
add Item-Level Targeting to any item, so that item will only be installed when the conditions are
true. In the example below you can see that the Telnet Client will only be installed on portable
computers.

You do not need to add Item-Level Targeting for this example, it is just shown here for
future reference.
