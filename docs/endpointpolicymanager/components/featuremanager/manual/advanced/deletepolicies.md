You can delete a policy by right-clicking it and selecting **Delete Policy**.

:::note
This will not revert the current state on the machine. That is, a policy set to install a
feature, upon deletion, will not uninstall a feature. And a policy set to uninstall a feature, when
deleted, will not reinstall a feature.
