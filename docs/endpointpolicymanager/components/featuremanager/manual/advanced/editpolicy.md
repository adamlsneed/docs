# Editing a Policy

You can edit a policy by right-clicking the policy and selecting **Edit policy**.

Inside the Edit Policy window, you can add comments, and change the install type from **Install** to
**Uninstall** or vice versa. Additionally, you can change the state so that the policy doesn't apply
anymore. This will not revert the policy or make any changes, but future machines will not pick up
the policy.

In the bottom left corner, you can see the Item-Level Targeting button. This is explained in the
next section in more detail.
