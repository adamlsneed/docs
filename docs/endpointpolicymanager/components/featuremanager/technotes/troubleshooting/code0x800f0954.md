# Endpoint Policy Feature Manager for Windows doesn't appear to be working and we're getting error code 0x800f0954. What can I try?

Underneath the hood …PPFMW is calling the DISM command.

The error you're getting, 0x800f0954… would be happening if Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) Feature Manager for Windows -or- DISM by itself was doing the work.

```
Error: Couldn't get the list of enabled Optional Feature. Error code: 0x800f0954
```

```
Error: Could not get optional feature info. Feature name: XPS.Viewer~~~~0.0.1.0, Error code: 
0x800F0954
```

We are finding that this error seems to point to DISM and WSUS fighting.

**Step 1 –** So, here are some things to try.. one by one..:

Try this Group Policy setting on one affected machine. Use LOCAL Group Policy as a quick test.

```
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System
```

Set "Specify settings for optional component installation and component repair" to Enable this and

Set "Download repair content and optional features directly from Windows Update instead of Windows
Server Update Services (WSUS)" to Enabled.

Then REBOOT.. and retry.

**Step 2 –** We think this is how you have WSUS set up.. but instead of using the first two fields
of "Set the intranet update serice…" use the "Set the alternate download server."

This will be a little harder to do a small scale test… but by the time you're done you want to make
sure the test machine is not getting the ORIGINAL WSUS setting, and instead is getting this updated
setting.

Then REBOOT.. and retry.

**Step 3 –** MAYBE Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager for Windows is expressly having problems
ONLY when trying to add .NET Framework. Just for NOW, try NOT adding .NET framework, and tell us if
it works.

**Step 4 –** After you've done ALL three steps above try "Step 1" in this article:
