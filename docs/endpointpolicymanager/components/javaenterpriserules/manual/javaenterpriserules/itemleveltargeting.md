# Checking Item-Level Targeting

Item-Level Targeting (ILT) filters can apply and match (or not match) to any Endpoint Policy Manager
Java Rules Manager rule. If an ILT filter evaluates to TRUE, then it will appear in the Java Rule
Set. If an ILT filter evaluates to FALSE, then it will be removed from the Java Rule Set.
