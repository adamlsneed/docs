# Exporting Collections

Appendix A: Advanced Concepts explains how to use the Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter to wrap up
any Endpoint Policy Manager directives and deliver them using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and
Intune), KACE, your own MDM service, or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. To export a policy for later
use using Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, right-click the
collection or the policy and select **Export to XML**. This will enable you to save an XML file,
which you can use later.

Remember that Endpoint Policy Manager RDP policies can be created and exported on the User or
Computer side. For instance, below we have a collection being exported.
