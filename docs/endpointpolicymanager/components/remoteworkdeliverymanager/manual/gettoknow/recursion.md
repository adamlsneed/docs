This wizard has many of the same screens as the previous wizards. With that being said, there are
two screens that are different. The first is the Specify the copy source screen. On this screen, you
can specify paths where you want to copy a whole share, or you can specify that you want to start in
the middle of a share and then work recursively forward. Below you can see an example of a valid
syntax for copying a single folder and all of its contents.

Using \*\* will turn recursion on. Next, you can specify the number of levels down in the Recursion
field. Using the same information as shown previously take all files from all folders with Demos in
the name. For example:

```
\\dc2016\share\folder1\Demos
\\dc2016\share\folder2\Demos
\\dc\share\ABC\DEF\RRT\Demos\abc\abd\DemosÂ 
```

You can also specify \*\* at the end of a path, and all subfolders will be delivered, as well.

On the next screen you can use the Show Preview button, which will show you which folders and files
are going to be copied. You can see an example of this below.

:::note
There are other Wildcards available beyond \*\*. See the section on Wildcards and
Variables later in the manual.

The other unique screen in this wizard is the one that provides the ability to specify the file
size, creation date and time, and modified date and time. When you change these settings, it reduces
the number of files copied during an operation.

You can also require that files be only copied when an attribute is set or not set.
