# How can I make applications install sequentially / in order (and how does it work?)

By default, Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Remote Work Delivery Manager will
install applications in any order, not the order specified in the precedence list.

However, you can change this behavior by making a Collection. Then on the Collection you may select
the **Process policies sequentially** checkbox:

![757_2_img-02-6sd54v5sd4f_950x553](/images/endpointpolicymanager/remoteworkdelivery/757_2_img-02-6sd54v5sd4f_950x553.webp)

This will ensure the processing order within the collection.

That being said, you do need to be careful around this when you specify a post-copy **Run process**
or **Run PowerShell Script**.

Endpoint Policy Manager Remote Work Delivery Manager guarantees that it will wait for the Run
Process to exit, or wait until the post-action PowerShell script is complete before it starts
downloading the next item.

So, if you use a PowerShell script, you have full control and thus full responsibility over
individual commands.

For example, if you use Start-Process from a PowerShell script, and want to wait until the process
itÂ created finishes and exits, it is your responsibility to use the wait switch. And finally exit
and close the script, thus completing it.

But if your goals are modest, and you simply want to download applications in order, and at the end
of each download, run a single installer (either .msi or .exe), then we recommend the **Run
Process** method instead of PowerShell.
