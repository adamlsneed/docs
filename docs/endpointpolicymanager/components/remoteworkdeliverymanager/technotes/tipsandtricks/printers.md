# How To deploy a TCP/IP Printer using Endpoint Policy Manager Remote Work Delivery Manager

**Step 1 –** Zip up the Printer setup files and store on a network share that is accessible to the
users that need to have the printer installed.

For Example:

![571_1_image-20210320020022-1](/images/endpointpolicymanager/remoteworkdelivery/571_1_image-20210320020022-1.webp)

:::note
This zip should contain the driver INF file for the printer to be installed.

**Step 2 –** Using the Microsoft Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), create a new Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) RWDM Standard Policy on either the Computer side (using
Switched-Mode), or the User side.

**Step 4 –** Select Apply this policy to all users who log on to the computer (switched mode), then
click **Next**.

**Step 6 –** Specify the target folder on the endpoint(s) where you would like the zip to be
downloaded to, provide the file name for the destination, then click **Next**. 

:::note
The target folder will be created if it does not exist

At the Post-copy actions screen select the **Run PowerShell script**, and **Run process or script as
user** options, then add/edit the command lines below as needed to reflect what is needed for your
specific printer model, then click **Next**.
