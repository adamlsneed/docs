# Install software using web-based shares

Want to deploy software OVER THE WEB using Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)? You
can do that with Endpoint Policy Manager Remote Work Delivery Manager. Just point toward the file on
a web service like S3, Dropbox, Azure, etc. And ... that's it. Endpoint Policy Manager will also
uninstall the software when the policy no longer applies. It's easy, and fast. (And Powerful!)
