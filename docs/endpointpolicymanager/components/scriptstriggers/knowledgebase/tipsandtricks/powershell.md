# How to deliver network drive mappings with PowerShell using Scripts Manager

**Step 1 –** Create a new GPO and link it to the User OU or Domain that contains the users that will
need to receive the drive mapping.

**Step 2 –** Edit the GPO and expand the User Configuration > Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) > Scripts Manager Section.

**Step 3 –** With the Scripts Manager section selected click "ADD NEW COLLECTION" then give the
collection a descriptive name, and click OK.

**Step 4 –** Next either select the collection name under the left side of the screen or
double-click on the collection name to open the collection.

**Step 5 –** With the collection name selected click "ADD NEW POLICY".

**Step 6 –** Click Next to get to the "On apply action" screen, then choose "PowerShell script" from
the dropdown menu.

**Step 7 –** Next, paste in the script below to the text window, and ensure that "Run script as
user" is the only option checked.

```
if (-not(get-psdrive -name "Z" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {    New-PSDrive -name "Z" -PSProvider FileSystem -Root \\server\share -Persist    }
```

Remember to edit the script to match what is needed for your environment, replacing "Z" with the
drive letter you wish to map, for example if you want to map H: then replace "Z" with "H". Also,
replace \\server\share with the UNC path of the share you wish to map.

The "On apply action" screen should look similar to below:

**Step 8 –** Then click Next, then Next again (skipping the "On revert action"screen) until you get
to the "Specify process mode" screen. Ensure that the "Always" radio button is selected then click
Next, give the policy a descriptive name, then click Finish.

**Step 9 –** Test the policy by logging into a domain-joined computer with a domain user account
from the (User) OU or Domain where this GPO is linked then run `"gpupdate"`, afterward open File
Explorer and verify that you see the new drive mapping.

:::note
If using Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts Manager VPN Triggers to map drives on VPN connect
you may need to add a delay to allow DNS to be updated before the drives are mapped, (i.e. to wait
15 seconds use "Start-Sleep -s 15" for PowerShell, or "Timeout /T 15 >nul" for Batch files.
:::


If you do not see the drive mapping in File Explorer but can see the drive mapping when running "Net
Use" from the CMD prompt try enabling the "Launch folder windows in a separate process" option (see
image below) to see if that resolves the issue.
