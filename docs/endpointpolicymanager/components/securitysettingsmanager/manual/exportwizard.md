Setting Item-Level Targeting is completely optional. If desired, when the exported XML file is used
with Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, these filters will specify
exactly which users and computers will get these exported settings. If you change your mind and
don't wish to use any targeting filters, simply uncheck Enable Targeting Filters, which will then
remove any filters you put in place.

location and filename to save your XML file.
