# Getting to Know Endpoint Policy Manager Security Settings Manager

Endpoint Policy Manager Security Settings Manager is a node you see within every GPO you create.
While Endpoint Policy Manager Security Settings Manager is listed on both the Computer and User
sides, it only functions on the the computer side. Below you can see the export option available.

The only job of the Endpoint Policy Manager Security Settings Manager node is to export the
computer-side security settings as an XML file. This XML file can be used with Endpoint Policy
Manager Exporter (with Microsoft Endpoint Manager [SCCM and Intune], KACE, etc.) or uploaded to
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

:::note
Additionally, if you use the PolicyPak Cloud service, you can even deliver these Group
Policy security settings to non-domain-joined machines over the Internet.
