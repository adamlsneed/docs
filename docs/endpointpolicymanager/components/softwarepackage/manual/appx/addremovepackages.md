# Adding or Removing AppX Packages

The Microsoft Store is full of useful applications. However, users do not always select the apps
that you want them to download. This is where Software Package Manager can force the installation of
the apps you want via AppX policies. Additionally, you may want to remove AppX packages as well.
Windows itself will request unwanted applications for the user from the Microsoft Store. Below we
can see pre-installed applications like Duolingo, Pandora, and Skype. Windows versions before 20H1
very often have quite cluttered Start menus, as shown in the figure.

However, even newer versions of Windows still have some store applications , installed, like Skype,
even though the default Start menu is cleaner. In both cases you might want to remove applications
that are not needed..
