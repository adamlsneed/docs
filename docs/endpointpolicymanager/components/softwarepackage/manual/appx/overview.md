# AppX Policies and Settings

In the example below, we're going to deliver a AppX (Microsoft Store app) to a selection of users.
The shortcut will appear when the policy applies, and it will disappear when the policy no longer
applies (i.e., when it falls out of scope).

**Step 1 –** Start out on your GPMC management station to create a group policy object (GPO) and
link it to your users. In this example, we have a GPO created and linked it to the East Sales Users
organizational unit (OU).

**Step 2 –** Next, within the GPO Editor, go to User Configuration > Endpoint Policy Manager > App
Delivery & Patching Pak > Software Package Manager. Right-click on New Windows Store (AppX) Policy.

**Step 3 –** Next, you will need to choose if you want to install a package or remove a package.
These options will be explained further in the "AppX: Install Package" and "AppX: Remove Package"
sections.
