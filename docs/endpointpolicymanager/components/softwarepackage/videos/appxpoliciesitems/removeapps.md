# Endpoint Policy Manager: Remove built-in Windows 10 / 11 apps (including those in-the-box) included with Windows!

Trying to remove built-in apps on Windows 10 or Windows 11? Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) lets you do it, provided you follow a few rules. This video shows where

PP CSE to perform.
