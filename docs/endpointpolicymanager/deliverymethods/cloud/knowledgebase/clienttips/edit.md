# What are the most common questions about editing policies using the Endpoint Policy ManagerCloud policy editor (instead of using the MMC to upload to Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud?)

The Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud Policy Editor allows you to create
and edit your own policies inside Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud without having to pre-create, then
upload them.

Here are the most common questions and answers:

Q:Is this all of the Admin Templates Windows, Control Panel, and system stuff / ADMX items I would
see as if I was inside the GPMC?

A:Yes.

Q:Where are **the** Security settings?

A:Those aren't ADMX settings. We're working on an editor for that too.

Q:Do I need to update my Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
Client Side Extension in any way?

A:No.

Q:What versions of Office do you have ADMX settings for?

A:We will keep it automatically updated to the latest version available.

Q:How is this kept up to date?

A:We do it for you. For Windows, Office and Endpoint Policy Manager ADMX settings.

Q:What about Custom ADMX, like Acrobat and Chrome? Can I upload those myself?

A:Not yet, Coming soon.

Q:Why don't you have editors for all the other types: GPPrefs, Security, and Endpoint Policy Manager
Settings?

A:We're working on them one by one.

Q:Will ALL policy types (eventually) be editable within PP Cloud?

A:Yes. That's the goal. But one type will never be supported, PP Application Settings manager.
You'll always need some kind of admin station to make those policies, export them, then upload them.

Q:Can I edit previously uploaded PP Admin Template settings using the PP Cloud editor?

A:Yes. If you encounter trouble, please open a support ticket so we can fix that.

Q:How are USERS and GROUPS supported within ILT in cloud?

A:Basically the same way. If you know the SID of the groupGROUP or USER you would place it into the
SID box. If the SID is not known, the ILT engine does its best to evaluate by name, but it's not
guaranteed.

Q:I have another question.

A:Great, ask it in the FORUMS please in the PP Cloud section.

Q:Why did you build this?

A:Because its awesome, and it needed to be done.
