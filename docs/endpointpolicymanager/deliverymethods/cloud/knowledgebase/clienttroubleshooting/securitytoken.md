# I get the message "At least one security token in the message could not be validated" during PPCloud client installation. How do I work around this?

During Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud client installation you might get
a message which looks like this.

What's happened here is that your company's certificate (which lives in Endpoint Policy Manager
Cloud servers) has expired. This can happen after being a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud customer for
a few years.

There is an easy workaround though. Simply revoke (which automatically re-issues) the company
certificate like this.

Then re-download the MSIs here, and re-attempt your Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud join.
