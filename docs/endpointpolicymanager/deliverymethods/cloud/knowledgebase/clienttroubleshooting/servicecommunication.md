# Troubleshoot communication from the Cloud Client and Cloud Service

To test the connection between the client and service, start by entering the
 `PPCLOUD /SYNC` command from the command line. If the return message is Could not sync with cloud,
the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud client cannot communicate with
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Server.

The main reasons for this connection issue are:

- No internet connection at all
- Internet connection behind a proxy server
- The Time and Date on the client is more than about 5 minutes off from the real time

Follow the steps below to troubleshoot the connection issue.

**Step 1 –** To test if the computer can reach Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, use Telnet from the
affected (wait listed) machine and perform a Telnet test to the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
Service.

:::note
If you don't have Telnet on Windows, see this video on
[How to Enable Telnet on Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghGAfmz4gaA) for additional
information.

**Step 2 –** At a command prompt, type in the following: `telnet cloud-agent.endpointpolicymanager.com 443`

- If the command just hangs and takes a long time to complete, then comes back with Connection
  failed, then the communication failed i.
- If the command clears the screen and the cursor goes to the top, then the communication passes.
  See the image below for example.

**Step 3 –** You can also try `telnet cloud-agent.endpointpolicymanager.com 80`

- If the command just hangs and takes a long time to complete, then comes back with "Connection
  failed", then the communication failed.
- If the command clears the screen and the cursor goes to the top, then the communication passes.

Additional Considerations

- If the connection fails, that could mean there is some kind of proxy. To configure the proxy for
  the system, see the
  [I always use a proxy and the cloud client cannot seem to make contact with the services (see FAQ Item #3 above first.) What else can I try?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/cloud/knowledgebase/clienttroubleshooting/proxyservices.md) topic
  for additional information.
- If the connection passes, that could mean the Date and Time are wrong on the machine. First
  manually try to correct the date and time. Then run `PPCLOUD /SYNC` command and see if it
  succeeds. If that still fails to work, see the
  [I am getting an error about "GPSVC failed at sign-in". This error occurs exactly one time. What does this mean?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/installation/knowledgebase/installandupgrade/gpsvcfailed.md) topic
  for additional information on alternative time fix instructions.
