**Step 1 –** First download the MacOS Client for Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) Cloud as seen here.

password) and keep the file and password handy.

At this point the MacOS Client for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud is installed, but it is not yet
enrolled in Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

**Step 6 –** Using the SUDO command, register the machine in Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud with the
certificate you downloaded earlier.

1. Open a terminal window
2. Enter the following command

   `sudo policypak cloud-register --certificate /path/to/certificate.pfx --password 'certificate_password' `

   Where:
   ` /path/to/certificate.pfx` - the folder in which the certificate was downloaded.

   "certificate_password" - the password that was added when exporting the certificate. Export from
   step 3.

**Step 7 –** After completing the operation, the message "`Registered: YES` " should appear in the
terminal window.

Now the `PolicyPak` command is registered and available to use, but it must be run as root (or under
sudo.)

**Step 8 –** Sync with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud with the command

`sudo policypak sync`

When you see Synchronized: Yes you are ready to make rules in Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

You should see your Mac in the MacOS | All group like what's seen here.
