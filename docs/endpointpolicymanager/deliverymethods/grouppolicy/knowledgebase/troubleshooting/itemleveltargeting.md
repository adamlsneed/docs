# Microsoft August 2024 Updates Breaking New Item-Level Targeting in GPOs

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Item Level Targeting and Microsoft Item Level
Targeting editors may be adversely affected when
[OS Build 17763.6189](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-13-2024-kb5041578-os-build-17763-6189-522a6305-63d2-40e3-8084-2ab8f9589bc6)
or
[OS Build 20348.2655](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-13-2024-kb5041160-os-build-20348-2655-e186b7ab-3d1b-4f6e-a959-f3e5d0bad3df)
is applied to a system with the Group Policy Editor. In short, the “User in Group” option is not
available when editing new Group Policy Preferences or Endpoint Policy Manager items or when editing
old items.

## Workaround options

There are three workaround options that can be used to fix the affected GPOs. See the available
options below.

Option one: Uninstall

Uninstall the affected KB items using Control Panel. This will revert the original editing behavior.

Option two: Modify Policy

Copy/Paste a Group Policy Preferences or Endpoint Policy Manager Item with “already working” ILT and
then modify the policy to perform the operation; leaving the “already working” ILT in place.

Option three: Hand Edit the XML:

**Step 1 –** Make your policy and get the ILT as close as possible using “Computer in Group” instead
of “User in Group.”

**Step 2 –** Drop the XML to Notepad. Hand edit the policy to `userContext="1"` (0=Computer is in
Group).

**Step 3 –** Delete the original policy.

**Step 4 –** Drop in the modified policy.

:::note
The modified policy will process correctly, but the editor still wont magically show “User
in group.”
