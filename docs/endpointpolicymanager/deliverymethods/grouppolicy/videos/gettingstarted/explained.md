### Endpoint Policy Manager: Editions Overview

Let's get right to the point. You've got desktops, laptops, full VDI and Remote Desktop sessions,
not to mention oodles of laptops and tablets which are always on the go. And what's on these Windows
machines? The operating system, of course. Then on top of that, tons of off-the-shelf applications,
you're homegrown applications, various versions of Java, a handful of browsers – and a lot to go
wrong. Leaving users to set their own desktop configuration and security settings, you've got a
recipe for disaster.

Group Policy and systems management tools are a good starting point to manage your on-prem systems,
and cloud-based MDM solutions are a good starting point to manage your systems which are always on
the go. PolicyPak doesn't replace Group Policy or your other management software. We work with what
you already have and make it better.

PolicyPak is going to be your new best friend. We built it for I.T. administrators and managed
service providers just like you. PolicyPak is perfect for I.T. admins who want to increase security
and standardization and lower support costs or for I.T. admins or MSPs who need to secure and manage
PCs out in the field and in remote offices.

With PolicyPak, you've already got all you need. There's no servers to buy or build, databases to
maintain, schema updates to make or code to write. PolicyPak works alongside your existing
management tool to give you superpowers they just don't provide.

Use PolicyPak to standardize and lock down the settings for your off-the-shelf and in-house
applications and all your browsers; ensure specific websites open in specific browsers; force older
websites to use specific versions of Java; dictate applications' file associations; completely
eliminate local admin rights and UAC prompts; smack down malware, unknown and unsanctioned
applications; plus more superpowers all the time.

When you use PolicyPak Cloud or your own MDM service, you can deliver real Microsoft Group Policy
desktop, system and security settings, plus PolicyPak's additional settings over the Internet to
domain joined and even non-domain joined machines – really. With PolicyPak onboard, you can ensure
that your applications, browsers, Java and security settings stay compliant with systems on and off
your network.

Get started with PolicyPak today and learn the secret that other I.T. admins and MSPs use to keep
their machines and applications configured, compliant and secure.
