# Paks

Paks are a vehicle to deliver policies (components) to customers after they have selected a Endpoint
Policy Manager product. The edition of Endpoint Policy Manager a customer chooses affects which Paks
they get.

- An Enterprise customer gets all Paks, and therefore, all policies (components).
- A Professional customer can pick their Paks and gets the policies that are included in those Paks.
- A SaaS customer gets most of the Paks (the ones that are relevant for cloud-only based scenarios)
  and gets the policies that are included in those Paks.

Pak offerings change from time to time when new components are added. Below we see a list of the
available Paks from the Endpoint Policy Manager home page at time of publication of this manual.
