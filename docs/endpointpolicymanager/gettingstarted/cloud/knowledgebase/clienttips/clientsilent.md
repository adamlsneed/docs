# How do I deploy the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client via command line silently?

The Command line is an easy way to deploy the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
Cloud , providing a silent install that does not require a reboot.

Here are some examples of typical silent command lines to run:

```
To install the Cloud Client quietly with no UI:
msiexec /i "C:\Temp\PolicyPak Cloud Client for company name.msi" /qn
To install the Cloud Client quietly with no UI and no restart:
msiexec /i "C:\Temp\PolicyPak Cloud Client for company name.msi" /qn /norestart
To install the Cloud Client quietly using JOINTOKEN with no UI and no restart:
msiexec /i "C:\Temp\PolicyPak Cloud Client for company name.msi" JOINTOKEN="AXBCDeVXbieqP9WUWQwnYM=" /qn /norestart
```

:::note
Replace `JOINTOKEN="AXBCDeVXbieqP9WUWQwnYM="` with the relevant JOINTOKEN string for your
environment. See this video for more information on how to use JOINTOKEN:

[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud: Automatically Join Groups with JOINTOKEN](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/cloud/videos/upkeepanddailyuse/jointoken.md)

For more information on the MSIEXEC command line switches, see this article:
[Microsoft Standard Installer command-line options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/standard-installer-command-line-options)

You may also create a command file to run the install and collect logs.

```
setlocal
set d=%DATE:~-4%-%DATE:~4,2%-%DATE:~7,2%
set t=%time::=.%
set t=%t: =%
set logfile="%d%_%t%.log"
msiexec /i %1 /norestart /quiet /lv*x %logfile%
```
