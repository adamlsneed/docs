# How often does the Endpoint Policy Manager cloud client pull down new or updated directives?

The Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) cloud client pulls down new or updated
directives every 60 minutes while the computer is on.

You can also run the `PPUPDATE` command or `PPCLOUD /SYNC` which will force an update now.
