# My Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client or Client Side Extension isn't completing the installation; How do I fix it?

If you find that when installing or updating the either the Cloud Client (PPC Client) or Client Side
Extension (CSE) from the cloud server it doesn't complete successfully, it may be that the
downloaded file was corrupted or cut-off during transit. When this happens and our checks catch the
error, the installation for the corrupted file will fail.

To get around this issue, the corrupted file, the application that isn't completing the
installation, needs to be deleted so it can be re-downloaded. Please review the steps below to
determine what needs to be deleted.

## Initial Installation

As the PPC Client is already downloaded, it's the CSE that would be the issue here. You'll get
indication something is wrong when the Installation complete. You may end up with a message
something like this:

![968_1_image-20230925200947-1](/images/endpointpolicymanager/troubleshooting/cloud/install/968_1_image-20230925200947-1.webp)

**Step 1 –** Delete the MSI from the following path

````C:\ProgramData\PolicyPak\Downloaded
Installations\PolicyPak Client-Side Extension\xx.x.xxxx``` (where xx.x.xxxx is the
version being installed)

__Step 2 –__ To force an update immediately, open a command prompt and run the
command ```ppcloud
/CSEUpdateNow```; Otherwise, the CSE will update during the next
check-in.

## Updates

Corrupt here could be for either the PPC Client or the
CSE.

command ```ppcloud
