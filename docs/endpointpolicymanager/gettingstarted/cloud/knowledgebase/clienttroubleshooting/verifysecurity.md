**Step 3 –** If the computer's time is "off", change it so it matches UTC time.

**Step 4 –** Then join Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud.

**Step 5 –** After join, change timezone to your correct timezone.

**Step 6 –** Verify PPcloud still works with commandline: `ppcloud /sync`
