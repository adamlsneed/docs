# When must I use the Endpoint Policy ManagerCloud Client installer versus the on-prem Endpoint Policy Manager CSE?

The Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud Client is the software you download
to enable a machine to join your instance of Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, claim a license, and
download policies.

The Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client will also download the Endpoint Policy Manager Client Side
Extension to process of the policies.

When you install the Endpoint Policy Manager cloud client, the CSE is downloaded from the cloud
service automatically at the same time.

To keep the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client up to date, as well as the Endpoint Policy Manager
Client Side Extension, you need to be proactive.

Please see this article for keeping things proactive:
