# How do I start credit card billing with Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS Edition?

To start Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) SaaS / Cloud billing, you need to go
the Endpoint Policy Manager Portal (not the Cloud Service.)

Then when you're there, click on **SaaS Billing**, then **Start Subscription**.

Follow the directions after that.
