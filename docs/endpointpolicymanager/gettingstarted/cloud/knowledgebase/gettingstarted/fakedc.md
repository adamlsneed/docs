# What editors are there in Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud (and when would I need a "Fake DC" to do editing?)

## Part 1: Why we recommend a "Fake DC" and joined Windows 10 machine

First, we always recommend that Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud customers have an “Fake DC” and joined
Windows 10 machine via domain join for Testing Purposes.

The idea here is that if you can play with a Domain Joined Windows 10 PC to see how things work. It
should always work with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud as well, but there are some exceptions.

Therefore, having a very small two computer test lab with a DC and joined Windows 10 machine is
always advised.

Another easy option is to use VMware Workstation or Hyper-V to create a two computer test and export
station.

For a good overview, you can check our videos on Endpoint Policy ManagerCloud, particularly the ones
on requirements and procedures to get started. You can find the videos at the
[Video Learning Center](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/cloud/videos/videolearningcenter.md)

## Part 2: MMC vs in-cloud editors

We are always making improvements and additions to Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud with regard to
in-cloud editors.

Before we show the current table of what is possible in Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud editors, you
should know that there will always be more things you can edit with the MMC snap-in editors than you
can with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

For instance, we have Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager editors in both MMC snap-in
and also in Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. But the advanced features of the Endpoint Policy Manager
Least Privilege Manager editor are only available in the MMC snap in, and are not scheduled to be in
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud editors anytime soon.

## Part 3: Known issues

Additionally, while most other editors will be ported over, we have decided we are not porting over
Endpoint Policy Manager Application Manager editor to Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. To make those
kinds of policies, you will always need an editor station.

## Part 4: XML "round trip"

Additionally, you should be able to take any Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud XML and download it and
use it within the MMC snap in and vice versa. Because the MMC editor will likely be more advanced
than the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud editors, again, it’s strongly recommended you have an editing
machine available to you in case some feature is not available in the in-cloud editor.

## Part 5: Endpoint Policy Manager in-Cloud Editors

This information is subject to change without notice. For an up to date verification of what is
available simply log on to PPC and click **Create and link a new Policy**… and see what policy types
are available to create.

Here’s an example. Black text are policy types which are available. Grayed out items are not
available yet. Some policy types might be some percent complete, or might never be ported over at
all.

Lastly, here is the table of what’s currently in Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud editors and our own
self-assessed ranking of Percent complete.

The goal is to put the most important items in the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud editor, but keep in
mind you may also need an editing station.
