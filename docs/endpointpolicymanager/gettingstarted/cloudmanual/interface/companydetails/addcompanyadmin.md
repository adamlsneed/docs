# Add Company Admin

If there is currently only one admin at a company, a second one can be added using the **Add company
admin** action. After selecting this action, enter the details of the user and the roles the admin
should have, and then click **Create and Send Welcome Letter**.

:::note
Once there are two admins already set up, additional admins must be agreed upon by the two
admins who have the **Customer Admin Manager** role.
