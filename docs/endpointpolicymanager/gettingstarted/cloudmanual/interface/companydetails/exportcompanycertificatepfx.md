# Export Company Certificate as .PFX

The "Export company certificate as .PFX" action enables you to export the certificate, which is
typically embedded within the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client MSI to be exported. Typically
there is no need to export the company certificate. However, exporting enables some advanced Cloud
client installation scenarios if specified and directed by Endpoint Policy Manager Support.

:::note
If you perform the **Revoke Company Certificate** action, any previously downloaded
company certificate becomes invalid.
