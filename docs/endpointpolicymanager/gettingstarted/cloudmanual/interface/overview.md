# Web Interface and Controls

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud has several roles:

- Acts as a licensing broker, enabling some computers to be licensed through the Endpoint Policy
  Manager Cloud client MSI and connection to the Cloud service.
- Stores XML directives which can be created with the in-cloud editors or exported from the on-prem
  MMC console.
- Enables a relationship between licensed computers and groups, which allows them to get XML
  directives.
- Works as a delivery mechanism for created XML directives.

The Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud web interface contains the following sections:
