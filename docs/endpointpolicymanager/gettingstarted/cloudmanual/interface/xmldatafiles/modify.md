# Modify

If you attempt to edit an XML data file that Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud has an in-cloud editor
for, you will be able to immediately edit the item.

However, since Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud doesn't have in-cloud editors for all items, some items
will not be available for editing, but will be available for updating. In these cases, you would
take an existing Endpoint Policy Manager XML export from the MMC console and enter it into the box.
