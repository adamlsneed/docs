# Upload XML Data File

Video: For an overview of this section, see the following video:
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud: General Tips about On-Prem to PP Cloud Export](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/cloud/videos/gettingstarted/onpremiseexport.md).

You can use the **Upload XML Data File** action to create XML data files when you have used an
on-prem MMC editor, have exported the policy, and are ready to use the policy in Endpoint Policy
Manager Cloud. Most on-prem editors have an **Export as XML** option, which will create an XML file
you can save. Otherwise, you can select **View as XML in Notepad**. Once you have the XML file in
either format, you're ready for the next step.

Using the "Upload XML Data File" action in Endpoint Policy Manager cloud, you can then click on
"Choose XML Policy File to add..." and select an XML file. Or you can paste in valid formatted text
from Endpoint Policy Manager or Microsoft Group Policy Preferences.

Then you can edit the description and click **Add** to save your policy as an XML data file within
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

:::tip
Remember, after XML data files are uploaded, they do not automatically enforce any settings on
users' PCs. In order for settings to be enforced, those XML files should be linked to appropriate
computer groups with computers assigned.
