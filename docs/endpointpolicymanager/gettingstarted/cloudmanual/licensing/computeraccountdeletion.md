# Computer Account Deletion

When a computer account is deleted, its acquired license is immediately returned back to the
available license pool. To delete a computer, click on a group and go to the computer in the
Computers section. Then, select **Delete computer**.

The computer account then goes to the **Deleted** group. From there, you have two options:

- **Undelete** - Returns the client back into the queue to acquire a license from the pool.
- **Delete permanently** - Removes the record from Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud and, in addition,
  will send a signal to the client computer to uninstall both the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MSI
  and Endpoint Policy Manager client-side extension (CSE) from the Windows machine (during the next
  connection).
