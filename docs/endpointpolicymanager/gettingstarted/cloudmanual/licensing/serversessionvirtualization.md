# Server (Session) Virtualization

Licensing for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud with Server (Session) Virtualization varies depending on
your purchase.

- For legacy Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud monthly and Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud yearly
  customers, you may not license Endpoint Policy Manager with Server (Session) Virtualization.
  Without permission, as per the EULA, you are not allowed to use a single Endpoint Policy Manager
  Cloud license to light up a multi-session computer without a specific agreement. This is because
  Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud will see the license use as a single license for a multi-session
  server, instead of handling actual usage to the maximum extent of the server. If you need to do
  this, you must also have a corresponding Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Edition license
  where the number of sessions is expressly counted. You can read more about this in this KB:
  [How do I license my Citrix, RDS, WVD, VDI or other multi-session Windows version with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud ?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/licensing/knowledgebase/vertualizationcitrix/multisession.md).
- For Endpoint Policy Manager Enterprise and Endpoint Policy Manager Professional customers, when a
  computer acquires a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud license, the computer will not process on-prem
  or MDM directives as well, unless a corresponding license for that method is acquired as part of
  your purchase agreement. Because the server sessions are counted and reported by the on-prem
  licensing tool (LT), these could be incorporated into your license if reported and paid for;
  however, the server must be expressly licensed by an on-prem method. Without permission, as per
  the EULA, you are not allowed to use a single Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud license to light up a
  multi-session computer without a specific agreement. This is because Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
  will see the license use as a single license for a multi-session server, instead of handling
  actual usage to the maximum extent of the server.
- For Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS customers, licenses are only available for Endpoint Policy
  Manager Cloud, and on-prem licensing mechanisms are not available. Without permission, as per the
  EULA, you are not allowed to use a single Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud license to light up a
  multi-session computer without a specific agreement. This is because Endpoint Policy Manager cloud
  will see the license use as a single license for a multi-session server, instead of handling
  actual usage to the maximum extent of the server.
