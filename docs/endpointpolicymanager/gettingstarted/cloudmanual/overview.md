# Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Quick Start

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud is our system for delivering and
enforcing Microsoft Group Policy and all Endpoint Policy Manager special settings to
non-domain-joined, domain-joined on-prem, or remote machines. Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud enables
machines to stay protected, regardless of where they are. It is comprised of separate components to
enable you to control different types of settings. If you are in a hurry to get started, you can
start with a web browser and one Windows 10 machine and see Endpoint Policy Manager immediately in
action.

Here's the fastest way to get started:

**Step 1 –** Check out our **Two minute introduction** video then our Quickstart video here: Getting
Started with Cloud > [Video Learning Center](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/cloud/videos/videolearningcenter.md). Work through the
videos one-by-one to try out all the main features.

**Step 2 –** Additionally, we strongly recommend you have a mini on-prem test lab for editing and
testing purposes. You should work through each of the videos on the Test Lab Best Practices page and
make sure you have your free-to-use test lab working: Getting Started with Cloud >
[Video Learning Center](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/cloud/videos/videolearningcenter.md).

**Step 3 –** Use the rest of the manual to understand the finer points of Endpoint Policy Manager
Cloud including some key security settings.

Enjoy Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud!
