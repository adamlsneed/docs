# Setup, Download, Install, and Verify

In this section and the next section, you'll learn some more concepts, get a feel for Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud, and be able to ensure that everything works the
way you might expect. The goals of the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Quick Start are to help you do
the following:

- Set up your first test client
- Download the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MSI from Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
- Manually install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client-side extension (CSE) (for just a handful
  of client [target] computers)
- Verify Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud is working

## Setting up Your First Test Client

The Quick Start allows you to immediately see that Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud is working with a
test client computer. Your account has some pre-configured policies linked to the special All group
(explained later). The policies will perform the actions shown in the table below.

| Policy Name                                                                  | Applicable Component                | Actions                                                                                                                  | Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

You can also see the pre-configured examples within the XML Data Files tab.

![policypak_cloud_quickstart_1_499x241](/images/endpointpolicymanager/cloud/endpointpolicymanager_cloud_quickstart_1_499x241.webp)

Note that the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client requires .Net Framework 4.0 or later to be
installed first. You can download and install.Net Framework 4.5 for Windows from Microsoft here:
[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653).

## Downloading the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MSI

Each Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud customer has their own specific Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
client that must be downloaded. This is how your PCs join your Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
instance. You can find the client installer within the **Company Details** tab.

![policypak_cloud_quickstart_2_623x338](/images/endpointpolicymanager/cloud/endpointpolicymanager_cloud_quickstart_2_623x338.webp)

Select the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client that makes sense for you (32-bit or 64-bit) and keep
it handy for the next steps.

## Manually Installing the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud CSE

You downloaded the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client for your company from the Endpoint Policy
Manager Cloud service. Now, you need to install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client to join
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. To do this, run the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MS.

![policypak_cloud_quickstart_3_499x366](/images/endpointpolicymanager/cloud/endpointpolicymanager_cloud_quickstart_3_499x366.webp)

A window displays indicating hte installation is completed. The computer will join Endpoint Policy
Manager Cloud and will be part of the special built-in groups named **All** and **Unassigned**.

![policypak_cloud_quickstart_4_437x361](/images/endpointpolicymanager/cloud/endpointpolicymanager_cloud_quickstart_4_437x361.webp)

The Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client then immediately downloads any Endpoint Policy Manager XML
directives for the computer's groups. All directives should be downloaded and active within 10
seconds after the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MSI is installed and the computer has joined
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.
