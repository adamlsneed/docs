# MDM and UEM Tools Quick Start

You might want to use Endpoint Policy Manager along with the following UEM tools:

- MEMCM (formerly known as SCCM) (video:
  [Perform Desktop Lockdown using Microsoft SCCM and Endpoint Policy Manager ](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/applicationsettingsmanager/videos/methods/sccmsoftwarecenter.md))
- Microsoft Intune (video:
  [Endpoint Policy Manager and Microsoft Intune](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/mdm/videos/gettingstarted/microsoftintune.md))
- Symantec Altiris
- Dell KACE
- LabTech
- PDQ Deploy (videos:
  [Deploy and Manage Firefox with PDQ Deploy and Endpoint Policy Manager ](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/applicationsettingsmanager/videos/methods/pdqdeployfirefox.md)
  and
  [Deploy and Manage WinZip with PDQ Deploy and Endpoint Policy Manager ](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/applicationsettingsmanager/videos/methods/pdqdeploy.md))
- Specops Deploy
- Microsoft Group Policy Software Installation
- Manual installation (when running with admin privileges)

The wrapped up MSI files from Endpoint Policy Manager should work with just about any other software
distribution tool as well. Therefore, you can quickly deploy Endpoint Policy Manager directives
without needing to use Group Policy to deploy your settings. Just create the XML data file, use
Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter to make an MSI, and then use your software deployment tool of
choice to deploy the MSI. Once the MSI is delivered to the target machines, the users will pick up
the XML files in their own directories (or the Computers folder), and Endpoint Policy Manager
components will receive their directives. We've provided a handful of XML files you can use. You can
find them in the Endpoint Policy Manager Portal in the "Latest Manuals" section, as shown in
Figure 1.

Figure 1. The list of XML files in the Endpoint Policy Manager Portal.

Once unpacked, you should see a list of example XML files, displayed in Figure 2, which are wrapped
into an example MSI.

Figure 2. The wrapped XML file example.

The provided Endpoint Policy Manager -XML-`Examples.msi` can be used immediately and contains a
wrapped-up version of the provided XML files. Below is a summary of what each XML example does:

- `Ppam-winzip.xml` changes settings in the Password tab of WinZip 14.0 and 14.5.
- `Ppatm-screensaver-settings.xml` sets the Windows screensaver to 17 minutes and forces the machine
  to be locked when it is powered back on.
- `Ppbr-examples` makes some sample Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router routes. Specifically, it
  will route endpointpolicymanager.com to Internet Explorer, GPanswers.com to Chrome, and Mozilla.org to
  Firefox, and it will block Facebook.com.
- `Pplpm-run-procmon-elevated.xml` enables Process Monitor to bypass UAC prompts and run elevated.
- P`pprefs-shortcut.xml` shows a Endpoint Policy Manager shortcut item on the desktop.
- `Ppsm-rename-guest-account.xml` renames the local Guest account to ppGuest.

By starting your journey with our pre-configured examples, we can help you troubleshoot a lot faster
than if you try other items, so we suggest you start with these examples.

## Quick Start with MSI files and a UEM Tool

Below are two videos you can use to get familiar with how to export settings and then use them with
a UEM tool.

- [Deploy Real Group Policy using SCCM or Other Management System!](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/misc/videos/methods/sccmgrouppolicy.md)
- Deploy Endpoint Policy Manager Settings Using SCCM or Other Management System!

## Quick Start with MSI files and an MDM Tool

To get started quickly with our sample MSI files and an MDM tool, we recommend watching the
following video:

- [Endpoint Policy Manager and MDM walk before you run](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/mdm/videos/gettingstarted/testsample.md)

Then, you can learn more about how to use Endpoint Policy Manager with your own MDM tool on this
page: Getting Started with MDM > [Video Learning Center](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/mdm/videos/videolearningcenter.md).
