# Endpoint Policy Manager and Microsoft Intune MDM

:::note
See [Endpoint Policy Manager and Microsoft Intune](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/mdm/videos/gettingstarted/microsoftintune.md) for
an overview video of Endpoint Policy Manager and Microsoft Intune MDM.
:::


To start, log onto your Microsoft Intune instance and select Apps. Add the Endpoint Policy Manager
CSE, the Endpoint Policy Manager license file, and the Endpoint Policy Manager settings MSI files,
and deploy them to your machine.

Next, make assignments to computers. For each application you have to target, you can specify All
Devices (which will automatically address only Windows 10 machines), or you can pick a specific
group of machines. For command-line arguments, you can enter `ARPSYSTEMCOMPONENT=1` to hide each
item from the Add/Remove Programs options to prevent uninstallation. Using the flag
`ARPSYSTEMCOMPONENT=1` is optional.

Once you select the group, you can change the Deployment Action to Required Install. Be sure the
computer is MDM-joined and in the correct group. If the MSIs do not download as expected, see the
[Troubleshooting](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/mdmmanual/uemtools/mdm/overview.md) section.
