:::


**Step 1 –** To use VMware Workspace ONE (formerly known as AirWatch) with Endpoint Policy Manager,
use the Apps & Books section, and click **Add Application** to add the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE
MSI file, Endpoint Policy Manager license MSI file, and Endpoint Policy Manager settings MSI file.

**Step 2 –** Choose the designated MSI file. In the example below we are installing the Endpoint
Policy Manager CSE.

**Step 3 –** The Add Application Wizard should be run three times (not shown) in order to import
each file. As you do, specify the following deployment options:

- Install Context should be set to **Device**.
- Install Command should have` /ARPSYSTEMCOMPONENT=1` added at the end of its field if you want to
  hide the MSI from the Control Panel.
- App Delivery Method should be set to **Auto** so it becomes a forced installation .
- Assignment Groups can be **All Devices** or **Targeted**, depending on what you need.

This is the final result in VMware Workspace ONE:

**Step 4 –** As a test, on an example client, perform your MDM enrollment to your VMware Workspace
ONE service.
