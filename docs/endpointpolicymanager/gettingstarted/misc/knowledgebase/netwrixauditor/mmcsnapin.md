# How do I configure the MMC snap-in to open GPOs in Netwrix Auditor?

For a video overview of this process see
[Endpoint Policy Manager and Netwrix Auditor - Setup Steps](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/misc/videos/netwrixauditor/auditorsetup.md)

## Initial Setup for Netwrix Auditor

**Step 1 –** In Netwrix Auditor, determine where you Report Manager URL is. The item is found in
Netwrix Auditor under **Settings** > **Audit Database** > **Report Manager UR**.

**Step 2 –** Click on the link to open up Report Manager in SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).

**Step 3 –** Create a new SSRS Folder and give it any name you like.

![970_2_image-20231016154007-9_950x454](/images/endpointpolicymanager/integration/auditor/970_2_image-20231016154007-9_950x454.webp)

**Step 4 –** Enter the folder you just created then upload the` .RDL` file provided from the
Endpoint Policy Manager Extras Folder.

**Step 5 –** The result after the upload is shown below..

**Step 6 –** Click the report to get the reference string you'll use in future steps. This will
contain the Netwrix Auditor server, up to and including the specific URL which expresses just before
the report name.

![970_5_image-20231016154007-12_950x839](/images/endpointpolicymanager/integration/auditor/970_5_image-20231016154007-12_950x839.webp)

As an example, the string should look like this:
http://NetwrixAuditorServer/Reports_SQLEXPRESS/report/PolicyPak

**Step 7 –** Keep this string handy in Notepad or similar for thenext steps.

## Using the PolicyPak MMC to Call Netwrix Auditor

**Step 1 –** Use the latest Endpoint Policy Manager MMC to configure your management machine to use
Netwrix Auditor . Left click on the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager node, then right-click to **Open
in Netwrix Auditor**.  Input the string you collected earlier.

![970_6_image-20231016154007-13_950x582](/images/endpointpolicymanager/integration/auditor/970_6_image-20231016154007-13_950x582.webp)

## Optional Configuration: Use PolicyPak ADMX to configure the value automatically

**Step 1 –** If you have many Endpoint Policy Manager administrators using the MMC snap-in and you
wish to mass-configure this value, you may do so via the Endpoint Policy Manager `ADMX `Files.

Always use the latest Endpoint Policy Manager ` ADMX` files, are available in the Endpoint Policy
Manager download.

Please see [Troubleshooting with ADMX files](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/misc/videos/troubleshooting/admxfiles.md) to begin
using, or update the Endpoint Policy Manager ADMX settings

**Step 2 –** After the ` ADMX` files are in place, create a Group Policy Object and target it for
your MMC management stations.

:::note
Endpoint Policy Manager CSE will ignore this policy because it is exclusively regarding
the MMC snap-in.

**Step 3 –** Going forward, the ADMX setting will command the MMC snap-in and it will be
unconfigurable.
