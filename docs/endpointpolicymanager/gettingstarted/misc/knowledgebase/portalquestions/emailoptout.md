# Why can't I opt out of Emails when I'm an Endpoint Policy Manager Customer?

Emails are a key component to ensure that your product is up to date, free of bugs, and that you are
made aware of any and all security concerns. As such it is not possible to opt out of emails because
they are part of our commitment to you as a customer. We are also bound legally to inform you of any
such issues.
