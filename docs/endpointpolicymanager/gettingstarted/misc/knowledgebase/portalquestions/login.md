# Portal login troubleshooting

If you're experiencing difficulties logging in to either the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) Portal or Cloud Portal, try the log in using the browsers incognito method.  If
the issue was caused by browser cookies then incognito will usually work.

- Try Incognito in your browser
- Try a different browser
- In the browser where you encounter the issue..
  - Clear the browser cache
  - Clear the browser cookies

If you prefer to not clear ALL your browser cookies, see below for how to clear those specific to
Endpoint Policy Manager for different browsers - leaving other site cookies intact - and how to
clear the browser cache.

### Chrome

Chrome makes is a little easier to identify and clear cookies for a specific site.  Just navigate to
the login page and follow the sequence below.  In the example below we click Remove 4 times since
there are 4 cookies in use for this specific site.

## Browser Cache

In certain occasions you might want to clear the browser cache which clears cached data for ALL
sites you have visited.  For Chrome and Edge, remember to scroll the list and ensure only Cached
images and files is checked.

All 3 browsers have the Ctrl-Shift-Del shortcut that provides quick access to this setting.
