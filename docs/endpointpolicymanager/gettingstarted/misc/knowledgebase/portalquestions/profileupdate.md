# Changing a portal users information

## Profile updates - other than email

If a user needs to change their profile info, that can be accomplished from the **Your Profile** tab
at the top of the portal page.

## Updating Portal e-mail addresses

If the user designated as Primary needs to change their email address, they will need to open a
support ticket at
[Netwrix Support.](https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=tickets.html#netwrix-support)

The Primary has the ability to change the email address for all other users in the portal. Here's
how:

**Step 1 –** Log in to the portal as the Primary and navigate to the Contacts tab. Locate the
contact whose email address you wish to change and click **Edit**.

**Step 2 –** Update the email address and click **Save**.

updated has changed to **Get verified**. In order to initiate the verification process click here
and acknowledge.

confirm the email address.
