# How does Endpoint Policy Manager perform Folder Redirection or OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM) with Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy, Endpoint Policy ManagerMDM or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud?

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) as a product DOESN'T perform Folder Redirection
or OneDrive Known Folder Move.

Endpoint Policy Manager CAN, however, deliver the Group Policy or registry settings required to
perform these operations.

These operations are just built into Windows and OneDrive, and THEY do the work… Endpoint Policy
Manager just delivers the SETTINGS.

## Folder Redirection and Endpoint Policy Manager:

For Folder Redirection, use Group Policy Preferences to deliver the following settings that you are
interested in.

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders`

Name: AppData

Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ

Data: `%USERPROFILE%\Application Data`

Name: Desktop

Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ

Data: `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop`

Name: Personal

Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ

Data: ` %USERPROFILE%\My Documents`

Name: My Pictures

Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ

Data: ` %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\My Pictures`

Name: Start Menu

Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ

Data: ` %USERPROFILE%\Start Menu`

## For OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM) and Endpoint Policy Manager

**Step 1 –** Read this first:
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/redirect-known-folders](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/redirect-known-folders)
then use the OneDrive Group Policy settings to perform the work.

[http://www.mdmandgpanswers.com/book](http://www.mdmandgpanswers.com/book) in the OneDrive chapter.

The latest OneDrive ADMX files are always just installed alongside the OneDrive client.

**Step 2 –** So, we suggest that on a single, solitary machine, go to
[https://onedrive.live.com/about/download/](https://onedrive.live.com/about/download/) find the
download (or reinstall) for Windows 10.

:::tip
Remember, Even if you think you have it, just… re-download and reinstall it, just so I know you're
using the latest OneDrive client version.

**Step 3 –** Then, once done, on a Windows 10 machine, you'll look for the files in
`%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\BuildNumber\adm` (yes, adm and not ADMX for some reason.)

**Step 4 –** Then you can use then with your Central Store and Endpoint Policy Manager Admin
Templates Manager and/or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.
