# Which components within the Endpoint Policy Manager product family will work with what operating system?

The following matrix describes our product compatibility.

:::note
There may be some unusual circumstances where, for instance, you can install the Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud Agent on Windows 8 and later (Core Edition), but
Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences Manager will not run with it, since Group Policy Preferences is
not available upon that operating system.
:::


:::note
Starting with builds later that 732, Windows XP is not supported in any way by Endpoint
Policy Manager. Windows 7 Starter and Windows 8 RT ( and later) are also not supported by Endpoint
Policy Manager.
:::


:::note
Some PPSec Manager features may be not available on Pro and lower tier editions. As an
example, AppLocker requires Windows Enterprise edition.

\* Endpoint Policy Manager utilizes the built-in GPPrefs Item Level Targeting. As such, any item
which relies upon Item Level Targeting will evaluate to TRUE or not function, since GPPrefs are not
part of this operating system.
