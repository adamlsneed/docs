# Why does my mail anti-virus service claim that the Endpoint Policy Manager download ISO or ZIP has a virus?

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)'s "Guidance" has some example VBS / VBscript
files which can be flagged if your mail service is set to detect any kind of threat.

The VBscript examples we use are being detected...as just that. VBscripts in a zip.

They are in this location, and sometimes they are caught, and sometimes they are not.

The example files we provide are examples to use or ignore. And, we even put it into the readme of
the folder about the possibility of this file being seen by download filters.
