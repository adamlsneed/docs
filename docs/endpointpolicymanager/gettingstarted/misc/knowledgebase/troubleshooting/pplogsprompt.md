# How can I use Powershell to automatically say yes to the PPLOGS prompt?

Remember that two different logs are required to get on a computer in order to get Netwrix Endpoint
Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Support. Please review
[What must I send to Endpoint Policy Manager support in order to get the FASTEST support?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/misc/knowledgebase/troubleshooting/fastsupport.md).

Then, when you're ready to automatically grab the logs from the machine please use the following
commands (and see a sample result below.)

:::note
The commands must be run on the machine in question and will not work requesting the
details remotely. Therefore you can run a command like this from a scripting tool or anything else
where the command will execute on the machine itself.

`echo y|pplogs /out:"c:\temp\pplogs_"$env:computername"_"$env:username".zip"`
`echo y|pplogs /out:"c:\temp\pplogs_"$env:computername"_admin.zip"`
