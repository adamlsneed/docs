# Endpoint Policy Manager MMC: Showing History of items you create

Using this MMC enhancement you can see WHO and WHEN and WHAT Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) changes occured. This is great if you don't need a full change management tool
like an AGPM and just want to know the basics of if/when something changed AND perform a
point-in-time rollback.
