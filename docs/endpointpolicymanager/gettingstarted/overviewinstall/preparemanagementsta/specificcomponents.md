# Getting Started with specific components (Endpoint Policy ManagerLeast Privilege Manager, Endpoint Policy Device Manager, etc.)

Endpoint Policy Manager is now installed on an endpoint (which is temporarily licensed) and you have
a management station from which to create policies. To get a quick rundown of Endpoint Policy
Manager using the Group Policy Method, watch the
[Endpoint Policy Manager with Group Policy Method: Getting Started](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/grouppolicy/videos/gettingstarted/gettingstartedv.md)
video. To get a quick rundown of Endpoint Policy Manager using the MDM / Intune Method, watch the
[Endpoint Policy Manager and MDM walk before you run](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/mdm/videos/gettingstarted/testsample.md) video.

TIPS:

- You won’t need a license file because you’re licensed with COMPUTER in the computer name.
- See the Getting Started with MDM > Video Learning Center >
  [Getting Started](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/mdm/videos/videolearningcenter.md) topic for additional
  demonstrations using specific MDM services like Intune and VMware Workspace one.

If you want to go beyond the basics and really dive in to each component, like Endpoint Policy
Manager Least Privilege Manager or Endpoint Policy Manager Device Manager, or any of our components,
see the
[Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Knowledge Base Articles](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/)
topic, then locate the component of interest and its corresponding Knowledge Base articles and Video
Learning Center topics. For true mastery on the basics of a component, you should watch all the
videos in order within the Getting Started section of the Video Learning Center topics. These answer
the most common questions about each component.
