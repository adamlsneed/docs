# Getting Ready

In this initial Quickstart, we will be using the Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR client (admin console)
in pull mode only. For information about how use the Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR server in push
mode (which enables administrators to store and share data plus perform clientless auditing), see
the section called "GPCR Server with Push Mode."
