# History

The "History" button allows you to re-visit to a scenario you tested before. After you click on the
button, click "OK." The tests (in the defined order) and snapshot you used will be populated back
into the Results pane, as shown in Figure 32. This can be handy when you want to repeat a test and
don't want to have to populate the tests or the snapshot again.
