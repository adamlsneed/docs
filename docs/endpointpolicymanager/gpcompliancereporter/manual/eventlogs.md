# Event Logs

The Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR client (admin console) logs warnings and errors to the Windows
Event Viewer in the application log. Because a lot of data could be in the log, use the filters
shown in Figure 76 to make a custom view showing only Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR events in the
application log.

Figure 76. Creating a custom view for Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR events.

If asked by Endpoint Policy Manager Support, be prepared to export these events for analysis.
