# Licensing Information

Neither the Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR server nor the client (admin console) require a license;
but the endpoint does.

:::note
Watch this video to see how to request a license:
[How to Request Licenses from Endpoint Policy Manager by Creating a "License Request Key"](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/knowledgebase/licensing/videolearningcenter/requestall/licenserequestkey.md).
:::


:::note
To install the license file received from Endpoint Policy Manager, see the following
video:
[How to install UNIVERSAL licenses for NEW Customers (via GPO, SCCM or MDM)](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/knowledgebase/licensing/videolearningcenter/installall/installuniversal.md).
:::


Note that since the Endpoint Policy Manager client (admin console) does not need to be licensed, you
may run unlimited numbers of it in any organizational unit (OU). The Endpoint Policy Manager client
does not have to receive license files in order to work properly.

## Licenses and Reporting

Table 1 provides more detail as to what is reported through Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR.

Table 1: GPCR reporting.

| If the target (endpoint) computer has…          | Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR will…                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| The word "computer" in the name                 | Report everything: all Endpoint Policy Manager settings, Microsoft Admin Templates settings, Microsoft Group Policy Preferences settings, and Microsoft Security settings A computer acts as if it had a Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR license. |
| A Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR endpoint license | Report everything: all Endpoint Policy Manager settings, Microsoft Admin Templates settings, Microsoft Group Policy Preferences settings, and Microsoft Security settings The client machine will be fully licensed.                           |

In order to get Microsoft data (policies, security, and preferences), license all endpoints for
Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR reporting. You may also license Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR endpoints
if you are not licensed for other Endpoint Policy Manager products. You are not required to purchase
other AppSets or policies if you only want to engage in Group Policy reporting via the Endpoint
Policy Manager GPCR. To get licensed, run the licensing tool (LT) to generate a license request key
(LRK), then send it to Endpoint Policy Manager Sales.

## Supported Group Policy Settings for Reporting

Supported and unsupported Group Policy settings within a GPO or test are shown in Table 2.

Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR is licensed per computer; if a particular endpoint is not
licensed, it will not return data.

:::note
It may look like there are more unsupported settings than supported settings. However, the
settings that are supported cover the top 90% of tasks that administrators typically do with Group
Policy and the unsupported settings cover the bottom 10%. We will be expanding coverage as needed in
the future.
