# Troubleshooting with ADMX or Registry Entries

Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR has the ability to provide extended logging if something unexpected
happens. There are two ways to turn on extended logging: downloadable REG files and ADMX files. You
would use the downloadable REG files when you want to enable extended logging on just one machine,
and you would use the ADMX/ADML files to enable extended logging on multiple machines. The
downloadable REG files are found on our website at: PolicyPak GP Compliance Reporter >
[Knowledge Base](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/knowledgebase/knowledgebase.md). The ADMX files are
in the download of Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR, as shown in Figure 77.

## GPCR Downloadable REG Files

You can use the downloadable REG files when directed by the Endpoint Policy Manager Technical Team.
In this case, you would typically be troubleshooting the following:

- Endpoint
- Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR client (admin console)
- Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR server

To troubleshoot these items, you would download the REG files from our website and, as an
administrator, install the files to enable them. When enabled correctly, the component will create a
diagnostics folder, and logs will be placed inside it. In Figure 78 you can see the enhanced logging
enabled for the endpoint.

## ADMX/ADML files

You can enable diagnostics for the Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR family of products using the
ADMX/ADML files. First, copy the PolicyDefinitions folder into `\\<DC>\sysvol\<domain>\Policies` or
`C:\Windows`. Then, create and link a GPO. The new policies are at Computer Configuration | Policies
| Administrative Templates | Endpoint Policy Manager, as shown in Figure 79.

## GPCR Registry Entries

You do not need to use the downloadable REG items or the ADMX/ADML files if you do not want to.
Instead, you can manually enable diagnostics using Table 4. Note that there are other registry
settings that are not enabled by Group Policy. For the Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR client (admin
console) the following is not enabled by Group Policy:

Key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PolicyPak\PPGPCR`

Values: `DataDirectory`, `SnapshotsToKeep`, `SingleInstance`, `UseServer`, `ServerAddress`,
`ServerPort`

For the Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR server the following is not enabled by Group Policy:

Key:
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\PolicyPak\PolicyPak Group Policy Compliance Reporter Server`

Values: `DataDirectory`

:::note
You can use this value if you wish to change the location of the file-based database used
for the Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR server. The target location specified must have network service
granted full control. This is normally set up during the installation, but if you change the folder,
you have to do it yourself.
