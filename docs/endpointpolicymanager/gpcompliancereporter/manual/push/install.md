# Installation and Uninstallation

We recommend that installation of the GPCR Server Edition be on a server (Server 2008 R2 or higher).
However, Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR in push mode doesn't need to be installed on a server at all,
and could be installed on any machine (Windows 7 or higher). To start the installation, find the
Endpoint Policy Manager GP Compliance Reporter (Server).msi file, as shown in Figure 36.

Figure 36. GPCR server MSI.

**Step 1 –** To install Endpoint Policy Manager GP Compliance Reporter, click on the MSI file and
start the wizard (Figure 37).

**Step 2 –** Next, choose the domain group that will have rights to the Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR
server as shown in Figure 38.

**Step 3 –** Then select which type of database you want to use (see Figure 39). You can choose
Microsoft SQL Server Compact if you only expect a small amount of data for processing and testing.
However, in most cases, Microsoft SQL Server is recommended.

**Step 4 –** Once the installation process is complete, close the wizard.

If you need to uninstall Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR Server, use Add/Remove Programs and
uninstall Endpoint Policy Manager. Then, remove

`C:\ProgramData\PolicyPak\PolicyPak Group Policy Compliance Reporter Server` and all subfolders.
Additionally, remove the Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance Reporter (endpoint) license
from the Group Policy Object (GPO).
