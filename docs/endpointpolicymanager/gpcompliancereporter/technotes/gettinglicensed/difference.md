# What's the difference between Pull Mode, Push Mode and Standalone and Server components in the Group Policy Compliance Reporter?

You can use the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Group Policy Compliance
Reporter "standalone" which means NOT connected to a Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance
Reporter server. If you do this you'll be able to interrogate (Pull) data from endpoints and report
on them â€¦ but only if they are online when you make your request.

You can use the Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance Reporter "server" which enables your
endpoints to "push" their data to the server. Then Administrators connect to the server (and not the
endpoints) to run reports.

You are licensed for both "Standalone" and "Server" components when you are licensed.

The Server is optional but recommended to use because data will always be up to date (because it is
pushed.)

Additionally, when using the PPGPCR Server, you can save and share tests, results, history and
reports to be stored centrally on-premise and shared among multiple administrators.
