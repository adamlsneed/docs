# Can I share Compliance Reports, tests and history across my team?

Yes, this is possible using the server component of the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) Group Policy Compliance Reporter.

When the server component is used you can store and share tests, reports and history from a central
on-premise server across an entire team of Administrators.
