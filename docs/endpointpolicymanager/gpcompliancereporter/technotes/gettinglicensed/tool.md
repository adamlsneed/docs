# What if I don't run the license tool to "True-Up" my Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance Reporter every year?

You must run the license tool every year to get an updated license file for Netwrix Endpoint Policy
Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Group Policy Compliance Reporter. If you fail to run the True-Up, then
your one-year license expires and the product simply stops working.

For Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance Reporter, you will not be able to see if those
target computers are in or out of compliance any longer.

Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance Reporter stops reporting on clients exactly one
year after the license file is originally generated for each product.

So, at the 11th month mark, we automatically remind you to run the Endpoint Policy Manager License
Management tool to perform a "True-Up." We will continue to send email reminders and make a best
effort to call you if we see you're getting close to lapsing. At the one year anniversary, Endpoint
Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance Reporter will stop functioning – unless you get a new license
file from us each year.
