# What is "Truing Up" for On-Premise products?

In the previous example, you started with 3,000 machines and grew to 3,300 machines. That's great –
we want you to use your Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) investment the way your
company needs to, when you need to. You don't need to come to us every time your company grows or
uses Endpoint Policy Manager products for more computers. However, we do require that your license
catches up with your usage at one-year intervals. We call this "truing up."

Before the expiration of each one-year license period, the "Technical Contact" on record will be
reminded to re-run our license wizard, this time using the audit feature. The license wizard will
make a quick inspection of all GPOs within the scope of license that use Endpoint Policy Manager
Group Policy Compliance Reporter.

We simply ask you to re-count where you want to use Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance
Reporter the next year. You send in your updated license request. You "renew" the computers from
last year, and "true up" any overage.

:::note
It's possible you have fewer computers than you did last year. In that case, you don't pay
anything for new licenses. However, you are still bound to pay the maintenance fee for the highest
amount of computers found in the last three audits.
