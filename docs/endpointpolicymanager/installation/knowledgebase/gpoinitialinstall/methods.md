# What are the two ways that can I install the GPMC on my Admin Station (Server or Windows 10) machine?

There are two ways to install the GPMC.

If you want to use a server as your GPMC editing station, you'll need to get the GPMC installed
there.

:::note
This is already on your DCs, but Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) does
not require that you install the admin console MSI into a DC.

On a server, go into Server Manager and select it as a featureto add.

You can also install the GPMC on a Windows 10 client,which is preferred method. If you want to do
this, there are two ways.

## 1: Download the Windows 10 RSAT tools.

This is the most reliable way to get the GPMC installed. First, download them from Microsoft here:

Next, verify that the GPMC gets installed and checked on automatically.

## 2: Use PowerShell in Windows 10 (Windows 10 1809 and later)

If you install Windows 10 1809 or later, you can install the GPMC with a DISM command:

`DISM.exe /Online /add-capability /CapabilityName:Rsat.GroupPolicy.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0`

The result will look like this.

Now you are ready to install the Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Console MSI, which then gets you the
Endpoint Policy Manager node within the Group Policy Editor.
