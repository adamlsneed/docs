# How can I roll out the latest Endpoint Policy Manager CSE with Active Directory in a controlled manner using Rings ?

Microsoft recommends that you use to rings concept when performing rollouts of their updates and
patches. As such, Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) also strongly recommends you
do the same.

Please familiarize yourself with this article before continuing:
[Using Rings to Test and Update the Endpoint Policy Manager Client-Side Extension and/or Cloud Client (And How to Stay Supported)](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/upgrademaintenance/bestpractices/rings.md)

If you wish to configure or fine-tune the CSE auto-download process, you may create a file called
`update.config`, which must be placed within the Endpoint Policy Manager Central Storage CSE folder,
as seen below.

![640_1_hfkb-1128-img-01](/images/endpointpolicymanager/install/640_1_hfkb-1128-img-01.webp)

This file can be manually created in order to configure or fine-tune the CSE auto-download process.
This file should be created in the Endpoint Policy Manager Central Storage CSE folder, and the file
name "`update.config`" must match exactly, otherwise, the file is ignored. The CSE attempts to read
this file once every 90 minutes, but that is configurable in the `update.config` file itself.

There are two ways to use the newly updated updates.config file:

- Using specific dates and times to make rings and perform a rollout
- Using relative number of hours to make rings and perform a rollout

The idea is that you specify which computers are in what ring. You may have as many rollout rings as
you like. Then, you can use the RingCatchAll, which will automatically work  for computers which are
not specified to be in any ring.

:::warning
You must pick ONE style and NOT mix the styles.
:::


Therefore, if the first Ring element uses DateTime, then RingCatchAll MUST use DateTime too. If the
first Ring element uses HoursBeforeUpdate, then RingCatchAll MUST use HoursBeforeUpdate too.

Some notes:

- `<DateTime>2021-12-05 15:00:00</DateTime>`: This is YEAR-MONTH-DAY  and 24:00:00 format.
- `<RandomOffset>60</RandomOffset>`: Is optional parameter but doesn't work by itself.
- `<RingCatchAll>` is optional. If a computer is not specified within a specific ring, then it will
  automatically know it should be in the `<RingCatchAll>` ring.

## Example 1: Using specific dates and times to make rings and perform a rollout

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<PolicyPak>
    <CSE>
        <Updates>
            <Enabled>True</Enabled>
            <GenerateReports>True</GenerateReports>
            <ReportsRoot>\\PDC\Share\Reports</ReportsRoot>
            <CheckForUpdatesInterval>1000</CheckForUpdatesInterval>
            <Rings>
                <Enabled>True</Enabled>
                <Items>
                    <Ring>
                        <DateTime>2021-12-20 13:00:00</DateTime>
                        <RandomOffset>20</RandomOffset>
                        <Computers>
                            <Computer>Clean10.fabrikam.com</Computer>
                        </Computers>
                    </Ring>
                </Items>
                <RingCatchAll>
                    <DateTime>2021-12-21 14:00:00</DateTime>
                    <RandomOffset>60</RandomOffset>
                </RingCatchAll>
            </Rings>
       </Updates>
    </CSE>
</PolicyPak>
```

## Example 2: Using relative number of hours to make rings and perform a rollout

With this method you set your rings apart with number of hours between updates.

:::note
Use the `<HoursBeforeUpdate>` value to specify how many hours to delay. Note that if
`<HoursBeforeUpdate>` is 0, then the update should perform immediately after the CSE checks in and
sees what ring it is in.

:::note
 ReportsRoot and MSIROOT parameters supports environment variables, such
as %LogonServer% and so on, if you care to use them.

Setting up the Reports Share and Verifying Reports Are Working:

The share for reports should have the following permissions:

1. Administrator should be set to Read/Write (owner)
2. Domain Computers should be set to Read, Write, Create (but not Delete)
3. NTFS permissions should allow for All.

![640_2_hfkb-1128-img-02](/images/endpointpolicymanager/install/640_2_hfkb-1128-img-02.webp)

NTFS permissions should be set up as shown below, where Domain Computers has all rights, except Full
Control.

![640_3_hfkb-1128-img-03_950x424](/images/endpointpolicymanager/install/640_3_hfkb-1128-img-03_950x424.webp)

This way, domain computers (that is, endpoints) will be able to write reports but not delete reports
that they create. When enabled and configured, inside the share, you'll see log files named in the
following way:

`<ReportsRoot>\<fully qualified computer name>.log`. An example of this naming convention would be:
`\\dc\Reports\WIN7COMPUTER32.fabrikam.com.log`

When you look inside the file, you will see something similar to the following text, with one line
for each CSE update that is performed.

```
Fri Mar 15 22:54:25 2013: CSE has been updated from 3.7.545 to 4.1.711
Sat Mar 16 23:09:46 2013: CSE has been updated from 4.1.711 to 4.2.721

```

## Manually Triggering Updates

Endpoint Policy Manager products have four command-line commands to help with updating on demand.

1. `ppupdate /cseupdatering`. Forces a machine to check if the machine is in the `update.config`
   file.
2. `ppupdate /cseupdate`. When run from a target computer, this command will instruct the CSE to
   reread the `update.config` file, which is present in the SYSVOL. You might want to do this if you
   recently updated the `update.config` file and would like the client to know about those changes.
   Note that this command will not perform the actual update of the CSE, instead it will simply read
   the file and honor the new schedule and any changes.
3. `ppupdate /cseupdatenow`. When run from a target computer, this command will instruct the CSE to
   reread the `update.config `file and perform any needed updates immediately.
4. `ppupdate /cseupdatenow /force`. When run from a target computer, this command will instruct the
   CSE to reread the` update.config` file and perform any needed updates immediately.

:::note
This is necessary only when the` update.config` file's enabled variable is set to "False"
and, thus, not performing any updates normally.

## Troubleshooting CSE Automatic Updates

All machines should report something to the log files share (if set up in the `update.config `file)
and produce either a success or failure message. If you do not see a particular machine update or
perform a report, you can troubleshoot that machine individually. On the client machine, inspect the
following two Endpoint Policy Manager On-Prem Suite's log files:

1. Endpoint Policy Manager MSI logs are generated in
   `%programdata%\endpointpolicymanager\ppInstall-<build>.log`.
2. Additional logs (to see if the CSE is finding the `update.config` file at all) are found in
   `%programdata%\endpointpolicymanager\ppWatcher.log` (for 32-bit machines) or
   `%programdata%\endpointpolicymanager\ppWatcher_x64.log` (for 64-bit machines).
