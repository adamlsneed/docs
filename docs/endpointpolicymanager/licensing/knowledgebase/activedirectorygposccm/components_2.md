# What happens to each component when Endpoint Policy Manager gets unlicensed or the GPO or policy no longer applies?

This KB explains what happens when Endpoint Policy Manager gets unlicensed or the GPO no longer
applies.

An endpoint can become unlicensed due to a variety of reasons. Examples include:

- On-Prem, MDM or Cloud License expires
- Computer moves to unlicensed / never licensed location
- Using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, you specifically unlicense a component
- Using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, you specifically revoke the CSE
- You hand-uninstall or use SCCM or similar to un-intsall the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE
- You remove the computer from a licensed domain

:::note
You may encounter a pop-up like this if you are using pre-CSE 24.4. Note the pop-up is
opt-in only from 24.4. You won't see any pop up if you're using 24.4 or later.

See
[How do I make the Grace Period licensing pop-up go away?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/licensing/knowledgebase/troubleshooting/graceperiod.md)
for additional information on Pop-Up behavior.

:::note
The actual behavior may be somewhat different than what is described here. An endpoint can
have its directives removed because of a variety of reasons. Examples include:
:::


- Deleting / unlinking a GPO.
- Removing an XML file placed with SCCM or by hand.
- Removing an XML directive from Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.
- ILT evaluates to FALSE.
- WMI evaluates to FALSE.

Different components react somewhat differently when their licenses are removed, the policy which
affects them is removed, or when the Client Side Extension is forcefully removed. In any of those
cases, the Endpoint Policy Manager Client Side Extension component(s) will react to that. In
general:

- What happens when the component is unlicensed is that the endpoint simply doesn't pick up new
  directives for that component
- What happens when the policy is removed is that the setting will revert or be maintained (depends
  on the component)

You might want to get a better grasp on the unlicensed / revert behavior for each component. Each
component is listed here (current as of January 2018).

## Application Settings Manager

:::note
Will not honor new Endpoint Policy Manager Application Manager requests.

Unlicensed or Policy Reverts

![29_2_faq-01-04-pp-01](/images/endpointpolicymanager/license/unlicense/29_2_faq-01-04-pp-01.webp)

A setting may be set to **Do Nothing at Revert**, which is the default policy, or

![29_3_faq-01-04-pp-02](/images/endpointpolicymanager/license/unlicense/29_3_faq-01-04-pp-02.webp)

If the setting is set to **Revert**, the policy setting is reverted. The value displayed will be
performed at revert time.

![29_4_faq-01-04-pp-03](/images/endpointpolicymanager/license/unlicense/29_4_faq-01-04-pp-03.webp)

For Win32 apps where AppLock (UI restrictions) are used, like in this example, the UI becomes
unrestricted.

![29_5_faq-01-04-pp-04](/images/endpointpolicymanager/license/unlicense/29_5_faq-01-04-pp-04.webp)

When NTFS / ACL Lockdown is used, the end-user will be free to change these settings inside the
(previously restricted) registry.

![29_6_faq-01-04-pp-05](/images/endpointpolicymanager/license/unlicense/29_6_faq-01-04-pp-05.webp)

:::note
Some Paks may be set to System Wide Lockdown, like Java and Firefox, as seen above. In
those cases, all users on the system are free to make changes after the GPO no longer applies.
:::


## Least Privilege Manager

When unlicensed:

- PPLPM will stop honoring new policies when unlicensed

Additionally, and/or when the GPO / XML no longer applies:

- Applications / MSIs / Scripts, etc. with elevated tokens will not elevate
- SecureRun(TM) will stop preventing users from self-installing items

## Browser Router

When Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router is uninstalled or becomes unlicensed:

- The original default browser (as the user had it set before Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router
  was installed) will be placed back as default

Additionally, and/or when the GPO / XML no longer applies, any Endpoint Policy Manager Browser
Router "routes" are no longer honored. See
[Why doesn't Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router routes take effect the first time I log on to Windows 8.1 or Windows 10?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/browserrouter/knowledgebase/installation/twologons.md)

## Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Templates Manager

When Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Templates Manager becomes unlicensed Endpoint Policy Manager
Admin Templates Manager will no longer apply new PPATM policies:

- Within GPOs
- XML Based files or
- Via Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud

Additionally, and/or when the GPO / XML no longer applies, policy setting items work and revert
exactly like Microsoft's Admin Templates Policy settings. So when Endpoint Policy Manager Admin
Templates Manager policy settings no longer apply, they revert back to their Not Configured value.

## Endpoint Policy Preferences Manager

When licensed: Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences manager becomes the intermediary which calls
Microsoft's Group Policy Preferences CSEs. By default, we do not give our Endpoint Policy Manager
Preferences Manager licenses unless specifically requested by the customer (and this must be done
each year).

When Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences manager becomes unlicensed:

- In-box Group Policy Preferences is called directly; no more Endpoint Policy Manager involvement
- Endpoint Policy Manager will not process file-based XML directives
- Endpoint Policy Manager will not process Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud XML directives

When the GPO no longer applies, or Policy XML no longer applies:

- Endpoint Policy Manager will leave the Microsoft GPPrefs item intact / alone on revert when the
  item's **Common**> **Options** tab is set like this:

  ![29_7_faq-01-04-pp-06](/images/endpointpolicymanager/license/unlicense/29_7_faq-01-04-pp-06.webp)

  ![29_8_faq-01-04-pp-07-1](/images/endpointpolicymanager/license/unlicense/29_8_faq-01-04-pp-07-1.webp)

- Or Endpoint Policy Manager will delete the Microsoft GPPRefs item when the item's **Option** tab
  is set like this:

  ![29_9_faq-01-04-pp-08](/images/endpointpolicymanager/license/unlicense/29_9_faq-01-04-pp-08.webp)

## Java Rules Manager

When Endpoint Policy Manager Java Rules Manager becomes unlicensed, PPJRM will not honor new PPJRM
policies. Additionally, and/or when the GPO / XML no longer applies Endpoint Policy Manager will
stop existing mappings of websites to Java.

## File Associations Manager

When Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager becomes unlicensed, Endpoint Policy Manager
File Associations Manager will no longer honor new directives. Additionally, and/or when the GPO /
XML no longer applies:

- The system will maintain the last settings placed by Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations
  Manager
- The system will permit users to make their own changes going forward
- Other users on the system may make changes such that they will affect other users

## Start Screen & Taskbar Manager

When Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager becomes unlicensed:

- Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager will not honor new directives

Additionally, and/or when the GPO / XML no longer applies:

- The system will permit users to make their own Start Menu and taskbar changes
- New users with new profiles on the system will get system default Start Menu groups

## Security Settings Manager

When Endpoint Policy Manager Security Settings Manager becomes unlicensed:

- PPSEC will no longer process directives from Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud and
- PPSEC will no longer process XML based directives

Additionally, and/or when the GPO / XML no longer applies:

- PPSEC items work exactly like Microsoft's Security Settings Policy settings when the GPO is
  removed, or the policy is no longer applied or PPSEC becomes unlicensed
- Like built-in Microsoft Security policy settings, when these settings no longer apply, they are
  maintained; and not reverted back

Local admins can then make changes to these settings if desired.

## Feature Manager for Windows

When Feature Manager for Windows becomes unlicensed:

- The last set of Features and Optional Features on the machine will be maintained and will not
  revert
- PPFMW will no longer process directives from Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy
