# I have multiple domains. How is that licensed?

Here is the general process:

- You run the Licensing Tool once per domain and perform your count.
- Then, you add those numbers together.
- You then send us your License Request Keys (one for each domain).
- You pay for the computers you want to license per domain.

We then create licensing keys, one for each domain.
