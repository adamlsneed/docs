# We purchased our Endpoint Policy Manager license for a parent OU in our Active Directory structure. What happens if we need to add additional sub-OUs inside of the parent one? How will this affect our licensing?

Whether you purchase Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) licensing for a domain or
a single OU, the issued license is for allcomputer accounts that reside there, and any child OUs â€”
automatically. This means you can create and/or delete as many OUs within your licensed scope as you
wish. This makes our licensing structure highly flexible and worry-free. At the time of your
Endpoint Policy Manager license renewal date you will have the opportunity to true up, but, again,
this would only be for additional computer accounts within your AD structure.
