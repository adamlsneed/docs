# Does LT count users?

This is what makes Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) licensing so easy.As long as
a computer is licensed for Endpoint Policy Manager, all/any users logged on that computer will
receive all computer and user GPOs involving Endpoint Policy Manager. This means that the users and
computers can reside in separate OUs within your Active Directory structure. Only the computer needs
to be licensed.
