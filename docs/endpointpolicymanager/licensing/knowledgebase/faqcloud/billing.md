# How exactly does monthly billing work with Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS Edition?

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) SaaS Monthly billing enables you to only be
charged for exactly what you use, per month.  Therefore, you may install the Endpoint Policy Manager
Cloud client on as many computers as you wish and you are charged accordingly.  All customers are
billed on the last day of the month.

During the month, each day we automatically count the number of computers consumed (that is, where
you've installed the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client). Then at the end of the month, we charge
on the highest number of computers used within the month instead, automatically.  This is billed to
your credit card.

:::note
You are required to have two credit cards on file to ensure uninterrupted service.
:::


For new costumers — Note that the first month for new customers is a little unusual because you will
be billed twice in that first month. After that you will be billed once a month on the last day of
the month.

For existing legacy customers who transitioned to SaaS Monthly billing— Please skip month 1 in the
example and head straight to Month 2, as you will be billed for your usage at the end of the month.

This is a three month period example starting, with Month 1 as April mid month as the new service
start date:

April:

- You start with Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS Edition on April 15th.
- On April 15 you are billed immediately for the minimum use of Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS, which
  is 50 computers. However, since this is mid-month, you are billed a prorated amount for the
  initial 50 computers from April 15 to April 30.
- On April 20th, you install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client MSI on 10 more computers,
  making your consumption 60.
- On April 29th, you manually retire 1 computer, making your consumption 59.
- On April 30th (the last day of April) the highest number of computers used in the month is 60.
- Your Monthly Highest number for April is 60.
- We will automatically bill you for April for the 10 extra licenses you used beyond your
  pro-rated 50.

May:

- In May you make no changes, maintaining 59 licenses in use.
- Your Monthly Highest number for May is 59.
- We will automatically bill you May 31st for the 59 licenses you used in May.

June:

- On June 10th you install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client MSI on 141 computers, bringing
  your consumption to 200 computers.
- On June 11th you retire 50 computers, lowering your consumption to 150.
- On June 30th you install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client on 100 computers, bringing your
  consumption to 250.
- We will automatically bill you June 30th for the 250 licenses you used in June.
