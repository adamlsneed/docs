# What if I have multiple domain names within the MDM I want to license?

Typically, we license a single email domain suffix, like \*@abc.com for any Netwrix Endpoint Policy
Manager (formerly PolicyPak) MDM customer.

That being said, if you are using Intune, and have the need for many domain tenant names, it is
possible for you to provide the Name of account details (also called Company information) and we can
use that information to cut you an overall license for any domain name within your Intune account.

The screenshot below shows you what to provide to Endpoint Policy Manager Sales or Support when
asked.

:::note
This optional licensing method is only available with Microsoft Intune, and is not
available on VMware Workspace One (Airwatch). It may or may not be available with other MDM
services.
