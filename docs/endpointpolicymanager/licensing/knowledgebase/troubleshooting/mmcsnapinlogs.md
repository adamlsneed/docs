# How do I turn on MMC Snap in Logs (for troubleshooting MMC Editing or Licensing Import)?

If you are having an editing or licensing problem, you may be asked to supply MMC Snap In logs.

Turning on these logs is possible when you use the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) ADMX settings.

:::tip
Remember, The settings need to affect YOUR machine (the editor machine) and not the end-user
machine.
:::


After setting the policy, reproduce the error.

Inspect the logs from: `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\PolicyPak` and see if your issue has generated
any logs and/or obvious errors. Send the logs to support as instructed.
