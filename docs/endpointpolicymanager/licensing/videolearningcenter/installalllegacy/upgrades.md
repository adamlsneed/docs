# Endpoint Policy Manager: Universal and Original Licensing Installation and Upgrades for Existing Customers

If you've been a Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Customer for a while, you will
start to get Universal Licenses. These can be used on CSEs born from year 2021 and onward. However,
you likely also already have older CSEs (pre-2021) which also need to be licensed. This video
explains how to perform initial licensing and upgrades.

:::note
Please download and install the latest Admin-Console MSI on your admin station before
continuing (or else the license will not be able to be imported.)
