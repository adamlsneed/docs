# Company Administrators

For an overview of security features, including roles, watch this video:
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud: Immutable Log](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/cloud/videos/security/immutablelog.md).

Your company may have one or more administrators who share access. Those admins may have the same
roles, or different roles that enable different interactions with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. Any
specific admin's properties and roles can be accessed via the **Edit** button next to their name.
