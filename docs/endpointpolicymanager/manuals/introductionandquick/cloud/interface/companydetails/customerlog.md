# Customer Log

For an overview of this section, see this video:
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud: Immutable Log](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/cloud/videos/security/immutablelog.md).

The customer log, also known as the immutable log, is a very powerful security feature within
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

:::note
Only admins with the **Notification & Logging Options Admin** role can see the immutable
log.
:::


Nearly every step of every configuration is audited and stored in this log forever. Below you can
see a sample log where each row explains an action that was taken within your Endpoint Policy
Manager Cloud instance.

:::note
You can also push your immutable log to your on-prem SIEM (log management) system via an
automated email push. To set this up, watch the following video:
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Logs and Automatically Pushing via Email](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/cloud/videos/security/emaillogs.md).

The Immutable Log Viewer has very powerful filtering that enables you to see what actions were
performed, when, and by whom.

Depending on the event type, double-clicking on any line may provide more information. Particularly
interesting is the **EditPolicy** type, which has a special button called **Compare**.

Clicking the **Compare** button performs a straight XML demonstration of output between the policy
before and after editing. If you discover that a change is unwanted, you can immediately roll back
to the previous version by selecting **Revert**.
