# Other Policy Delivery Mechanisms

Licensing for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud and other policy deliver mechanisms vary depending on
your purchase.

- For legacy Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud monthly and Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud yearly
  customers, when a computer acquires a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud license, that computer can
  also receive Endpoint Policy Manager directives via GPOs as well, without needing an explicit
  Endpoint Policy Manager on-premise license. A description of this scenario can be found at the
  following link:
  [Endpoint Policy ManagerCloud and Endpoint Policy Manager OnPremise â€“ Together using PPCloud Licenses](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/cloud/videos/usingwithothermethods/onpremise.md).
- For Endpoint Policy Manager Enterprise and Endpoint Policy Manager Professional Editions, when a
  computer acquires a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud license, the computer will not process on-prem
  or MDM directives as well, unless a corresponding license for that method is acquired as part of
  your purchase agreement.
- For Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS customers, licenses are only available for Endpoint Policy
  Manager Cloud, and on-prem licensing mechanisms are not available.

If the computer is licensed for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud and Endpoint Policy Manager Active
Directory, for example, then all directives are merged together. In the case of a conflict, Group
Policy always wins.
