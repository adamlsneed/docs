# Operational Events

Events in section are divided into the following categories:

- User Action Allowed events (Event ID 1000+)
- User Action Blocked events (Event ID 2000+)
- Audit/Discovery events (Event ID 6200+)
- Admin Approval events (Event ID 6300+)

See the [List of Endpoint Policy Manager Event Categories and IDs](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/misc/knowledgebase/tipstricksandfaqs/eventcategories.md)
topic for all event IDs.

Each event ID will have the following fields:

- Path
- Command line
- Process Id
- Parent Id
- Policy Object
- Collection
- Policy

Here is an example of Event 6310, which shows that a response code was accepted by user and an
application was given the OK to run:

The reason code that is written to Event 6310 is from a fixed list in the Endpoint Policy Manager
Least Privilege Manager code generator tool and is not admin- or user-definable. When the admin
chooses a reason code, as seen here, that is what is recorded within the event on the client.
