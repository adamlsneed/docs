# Exporting Policies and Collections

The [MDM & UEM Tools](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/mdmmanual/overview.md) topics explain how to use the Endpoint Policy Manager
Exporter to wrap up any Endpoint Policy Manager directives and deliver them using Microsoft Endpoint
Manager (SCCM and Intune), KACE, your own MDM service, or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. To export a
policy for later use using Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud,
right-click the collection or the policy and select **Export to XML**. This will enable you to save
an XML file, which you can use later.
