# Exporting Collections

In
[Using Item-Level Targeting with Collections and Policies](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/manuals/desktopautomationand/remotedesktopprotoco/itemleveltargeting/overview.md)
we explain how to use the Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter to wrap up any Endpoint Policy Manager
directives and deliver them using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune), KACE, your own MDM
service, or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. To export a policy for later use using Endpoint Policy
Manager Exporter or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, right-click the collection or the policy and
select Export to XML. This will enable you to save an XML file for later use.

:::note
For a video demonstrating the use of Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager for Windows
with Endpoint Policy Manager MDM see

:::


Remember that Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager for Windows policies can be created and then
exported on the Computer side. For instance, below, you can see a setting being exported. You can
also do this for an entire collection (not shown).

:::note
Exported collections or policies maintain any Item-Level Targeting set within them. If
you've used items that represent Group Membership in Active Directory, then those items will only
function when the machine is domain-joined.
