# How to Install UWP applications using Endpoint Policy Manager Remote Work Delivery Manager

Using the Azure VPN Client UWP application as an example, this article will cover the steps needed
to install the Azure VPN Client using either the Standard Policy (SMB/UNC) Method) or Web Policy
Method.

:::note
It's up to the customer to ensure the UWP applications being used are legitimate Microsoft
applications and that the applications are signed by Microsoft.
:::


## Using the Standard Policy (SMB/UNC) Method

**Step 1 –** Download the UWP application bundle from the Microsoft Store. You can use the Microsoft
Store link for the application at this site (use at your own risk) to download the application
bundle:  [https://store.rg-adguard.net/](https://store.rg-adguard.net/)

Copy the Microsoft Store link for the UWP Application:
 [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/azure-vpn-client/9np355qt2sqb?activetab=pivot:overviewtab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/azure-vpn-client/9np355qt2sqb?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

**Step 2 –** Download the UWP application bundle, and store it on a UNC path that is accessible from
your endpoint computers, i.e.

```
\\server\share\Microsoft.AzureVpn_1.1069.25.0_neutral___8wekyb3d8bbwe.Msixbundle
```

**Step 3 –** Then using the Microsoft Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) create a new Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) RWDM Standard Policy on either the Computer or User
side.

**Step 11 –** Optional: At the Revert actions screen add a revert action, otherwise click **Next**
to skip.

You are done, give the Policy a descriptive name then click **Finish**.

## Using the Web Policy (Azure Blob storage, Dropbox, etc.) Method:

**Step 2 –** Download the UWP application bundle, then upload it to a Endpoint Policy Manager
supported web storage source. The following web sources are currently supported:

**Step 3 –** Using the Microsoft Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) create a new Endpoint Policy
Manager RWDM Web Policy on either the Computer or User side.
