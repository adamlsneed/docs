# How do I use Endpoint Policy Manager Remote Work Delivery Manager to update the Client Side Extension?

If you do not have an existing software distribution solution, delivery of software and updates can
be a bit of a hassle. Remote Work Delivery Manager (RWDM) can assist you in getting your software
out to your endpoints. This includes keeping Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) up
to date on all your endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- As the CSE is required to perform an installation or update, it must already be installed on the
  endpoints and at version 2536 or higher.
- RWDM must properly be licensed or computer in trial mode.
- The Installation MSI file is stored on a file share accessible to all endpoints that require the
  update.

## Creating the Policy

As with most applications, the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE come in two varieties – 64 and 32 bit.
This article will cover creating a policy to cover both.

**Step 1 –** Create a new Group Policy Object and edit it.

**Step 2 –** Expand Computer `Configuration -> PolicyPak -> Apps and Patch Management` and click on
**Remote Work Delivery Manager**.

**Step 3 –** Add a **New Collection**, rename it, enable and click **OK**.
