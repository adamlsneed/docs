## Overview

This article lists the steps to complete the **Access Analyzer** upgrade procedure.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to finalize the Access Analyzer upgrade:

1. After the **Netwrix Upgrade Wizard** finishes, open the **Access Analyzer Console**.
2. Verify the global settings match the initial settings.
3. If licensed for File System auditing, run the **File System\0-CreateSchema** job. This updates the schema for the tables, views, and functions used by the rest of the File System solution.
4. Run the **Active Directory Inventory** group from the **Schedules** node to confirm operability.
5. Verify that the published reports configuration matches the backed-up version. If necessary, migrate the `<AppSettings>` node from the default configuration path:

   ```registry
   %SAInstallDir%Web\WebServer.exe.config
   ```

6. If you are using Windows authentication to connect to the SQL database, configure the **Netwrix Access Analyzer Web Server** service to log on as a service account with **db_owner** permissions for the Access Analyzer database.
7. Have a user with the appropriate permissions log in to the **Published Reports** site to confirm operability.
