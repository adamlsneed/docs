# Administration

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer helps secure your network by ensuring users set strong passwords.
When a user enters a password that does not comply with the password policy, Password Policy
Enforcer immediately rejects the password and details why the password was rejected.

Unlike password cracking products that check passwords after they are accepted by the operating
system, Password Policy Enforcer checks new passwords immediately to ensure that weak passwords do
not jeopardize network security.

You can also use Password Policy Enforcer to ensure that passwords are compatible with other
systems, and to synchronize passwords with other networks and applications.

:::note
The [Evaluate Password Policy Enforcer](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/evaluation/evaluation_overview.md) contains
step-by-step instructions to help you quickly install, configure, and evaluate Password Policy
Enforcer. Consider using the Evaluation Guide if you are using Password Policy Enforcer for the
first time, prior to installing and deploying on your domains.
