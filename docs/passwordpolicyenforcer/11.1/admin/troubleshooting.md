# Troubleshooting

This topic contains troubleshooting information for the most common support questions. Contact
Netwrix support with any questions.

Password policy assigned to some users is being enforced for all users. Check the Default Policy in
the PPS Properties page. Users must comply with the default policy if no other policy is assigned to
them. Select the first (blank) item in the drop-down list if you do not want a default policy.

#### Password policy not displayed during password change

Open the Programs and Features list in Control Panel on the computer you are changing the password
from, and check if the Password Policy Client is in the list of installed programs. If it is not,
then install the Password Policy Client. See the [Password Policy Client](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/admin/password-policy-client/password_policy_client.md)
topic for additional information.

If Password Policy Enforcer is enforcing a domain policy, then search the Windows Application Event
Log on every domain controller for events from Password Policy Enforcer. If there are no events from
Password Policy Enforcer since the last restart on any domain controller, then make sure that
Password Policy Enforcer is installed on that domain controller and restart it. Check the Windows
Application Event Log again after the restart to ensure that Password Policy Enforcer started. For
local policies, search the Application Event Log on the local computer.

If there is a firewall between the client computer and the domain controllers (including Windows
Firewall), then you must create firewall rules to allow the Password Policy Client and Password
Policy Server to communicate. Windows firewall is enabled by default on Windows Server 2008 and
later.

Use the Test Policies page to test a password for the user. Click the **Log** tab to see if a
password policy is assigned to the user.

Make sure that the Password Policy Server is enabled.

Make sure that the Password Policy Client is enabled. See
[Password Policy Client](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/admin/password-policy-client/password_policy_client.md) topic for additional information.

#### Accepting passwords that do not comply with the policy

If Password Policy Enforcer is enforcing a domain policy, then search the Windows Application Event
Log on every domain controller for events from Password Policy Enforcer. If there are no events from
Password Policy Enforcer since the last restart on any domain controller, then make sure that
Password Policy Enforcer is installed on that domain controller and restart it. Check the Windows
Application Event Log again after the restart to ensure that Password Policy Enforcer started. For
local policies, search the Application Event Log on the local computer.

Use the Test Policies page to test a password that Password Policy Enforcer is accepting. Examine
the test results and event log to determine why Password Policy Enforcer accepted the password. If
the Test Policies page rejects the password, you must configure the policy. See the
[Policy Testing vs. Password Changes](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/admin/manage-policies/testpolicy.md#policy-testing-vs-password-changes) topic for
additional information.

If the **Enforce policy when password is reset** check box is not selected in the PPS Properties
page, then Password Policy Enforcer will not enforce the password policy for passwords that are
reset from the Active Directory Users and Computers console, or the Local Users and Groups console.
You should select this option during testing, or test password changes from the Windows Change
Password screen.

#### Rejecting passwords that comply with the policy

Use the Test Policies page to test a password that Password Policy Enforcer is rejecting. Examine
the test results and event log to determine why Password Policy Enforcer rejected the password. If
the Test Policies page rejects the password, you must configure the policy. See the
[Policy Testing vs. Password Changes](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/admin/manage-policies/testpolicy.md#policy-testing-vs-password-changes) topic for
additional information.

Set **User must change password at next logon** for the user and repeat the password change test. If
the password is accepted, then either Windows or Password Policy Enforcer is configured to enforce a
minimum password age. Disable the Minimum Age rule in Windows and Password Policy Enforcer to
facilitate testing. If you cannot disable the Minimum Age rule, then set User must change password
at next logon before every password change test to bypass the rule.

#### Passwords that are accepted in the Test Policies page are rejected during a password change

See the [Policy Testing vs. Password Changes](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/admin/manage-policies/testpolicy.md#policy-testing-vs-password-changes)
topic for additional information.
