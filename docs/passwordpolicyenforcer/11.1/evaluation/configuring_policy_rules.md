# Configure Policy Rules

The policy you just created does not enforce any password requirements yet. You can now configure
the policy to enforce these rules:

- Password must contain at least seven characters.
- Password must contain at least one lowercase alpha character.
- Password must contain at least one uppercase character.
- Password must not be similar to the user's logon name.
- Password must not exist in a dictionary of common passwords.

When you create a policy, the policy settings are opened. You can open the settings for a policy at
any time by clicking the policy name on the Configuration Console dashboard.
