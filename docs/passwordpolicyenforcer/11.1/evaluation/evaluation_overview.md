# Evaluate Password Policy Enforcer

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer is an advanced password filter for Windows. Use this guide to
quickly install, configure, and test an evaluation version of Password Policy Enforcer. Netwrix
Password Policy Enforcer helps secure your network by ensuring users set strong passwords. When a
user enters a password that does not comply with the password policy, Password Policy Enforcer
immediately rejects the password and details why the password was rejected.

Unlike password cracking products that check passwords after they are accepted by the operating
system, Password Policy Enforcer checks new passwords immediately to ensure that weak passwords do
not jeopardize system security.

:::note
You can also use Password Policy Enforcer to ensure that passwords are compatible with
other systems, and to synchronize passwords with other systems and applications.
